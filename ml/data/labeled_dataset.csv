the younger dyus extinction circa 10 900 b c caused a 400 ft rirse in sea level whan a very large comet broke apart melting the north american and greenland ice sheets that were 1 to 2 miles deep the u s megafauna and clovis tribe was wiped out massive tsunamies earth quakes fires ice age caused world wide devastation,1
it s just big waves,1
oahhhhhh ohhhhhh,0
it s called the paradise tax,0
my heart still breaks for the japanese people so many people who have lost loved ones especially the children and elderly i love the japanese people their kindness respectful honor they are brought up learning it s very sad,0
ai speculation at best fear mongering from the liberal left they will start claiming man made climate changes caused by fossil fuel use caused earthquakes and volcanoes,1
why do people stand there like this will be great for the internet like why r they so stupid,0
what the fuck kind of animation was that a water column may only rise vertically perpendicular to the ocean floor fukin ai bullshit,0
it s not so much the height of the wave which is obviously important but the wavelength wind waves such as what surfers like to ride can get very tall but have very short wavelengths and thus will crash on shore and dissipate quickly the energy of a long wavelength wave will just continue to push inland even long after the peak has passed,1
it is called a tidal wave stupid people,1
fake pictures in the beginning not interested in this junk waste of time,0
time to float,0
we had a tsunami but it did not hit us,1
you why do people ignore warnings and leave cars there by retainer walls stupid,1

tsunamis is v based on the shape of the basin,1
40 meters high i dont think so,0
eh these video clips suck there s ones 1 000x better than this this is weak views compared to what i ve seen,0
tsunamis can t form just anywhere shows rogue wave in the middle of the ocean in the thumbnail calls it tsunami,1
which one do you think was the rouge wave that shot from the coast guard cutter was shot as it went over the first tsunami there were no rouge waves anywhere in this video,1
what a fascinating video the power of nature is truly incredible however i can t help but wonder if we should be doing more to prepare for such events instead of just capturing them on camera it seems like a missed opportunity to focus on prevention and awareness what do you all think,0
fun fact most of the earthquakes and tsunamis in japan are caused by godzilla gottzirrah,1
this video is really impressive and the cinematography is top notch however i can t help but wonder if we re sensationalizing these disasters a bit too much while it s essential to raise awareness do you think showing these extreme moments might lead to more panic than understanding,1
i laughed hard when the narrator said that the underwater volcanos name is tonga honga kinga konga,0
finally a video that s not ai,0
this is bad n sorry for the people affected but the say like the waves are as tall as the empire state building n i thought that didn t sound right the whole world would have drowned,1
what about lituya bay,0
guys i think i found elon musk in the video at 5 49 the guy all the way to the left in the photo yellow helmet guy second one to the left of the screen we found him,0
being in aus we got a warning luckly we didnt get anything,1
wow this video is really impressive and captures the power of nature beautifully however i can t help but wonder if showcasing such extreme events like this can glamorize natural disasters and make people less aware of the dangers involved it s a complex issue for sure but i d love to hear what others think,1
you forgot about the largest tsunami of all time the lituya bay mega tsunami,1
fun fact september 28 was my birthday,0
waves were not 40 5 meters they looked like 10 or15 meters at the most,1
3 00 wow that s incredible how fast that water is moving,0
do you know mother nature maybe is doing this,0
how could you forget the 2004 boxing day tsunami that hit thailand and everywhere else down there those were the most impressive videos of the waves caught on camera,1

oscargreat that comment shows why i cannot take you seriously you say you know for sure things about me but you know nothing about me you make the same argument about evolution all the religious fanatics do you haven t seen two monkeys bring a human baby in life but i guess you have seen god making miracles despite the laws of physics,0

dynasingh2969 bro why comment if you don t find it funny i know 8t was cringe but you don t have to be like that about it,0
what happened to the nba music and men in general was a planned assault on boys masculinity in the schools by the female dominated teachers unions comprised of activist women s libbers lesbians and gays they actively suppressed the boys development into men with their war on testosterone and attacked their self confidence while doing the exact opposite with the girls boys are not the same as they were 60 years ago to us older guys it jumps out at you boys now act more like the girls of 60 years ago in fact i believe the girls of our time were even tougher than most of the boys i encounter today now they are more sensitive and shudder at political incorrectness or an off color joke in short mostly they seem wimpy and pussy whipped,0
none of this is as bad as it appears we have great users of cgi if you look closely you can easily spot the edits loss of meaningful human life is minimal those that did kick it were simply from third world countries their deaths are not relevant to the rest of us,1
the depth of the water behind the first wave in the coast guard video is much higher than in front of it many of the clips from the 2011 tsunami show an uprising of the water rather than a typical breaking wave its like the ocean takes a deep breath but never exhales poor people in all these videos the one in samoa is astounding,1
because is us territory,0
krakatoa was a big version of the hunga tonga hunga hapaai volcano in the year 1883,0
what about the indian ocean boxing day tsunami 230k killed smfh,1
don t mind the fbi getting taken out there crooked anyway,0
water seeks its own level,0
video sucked,0
5 02 i do not believe that person still have mask on omg some people are so stupid,0
need to translate wooukk wooouk wuk oooooh ah,0
you forget to include the 2004 indian ocean tsunami which is actually the world s most deadliest tsunami ever in 2004 indian ocean tsunami took the life of more than 250000 people,1
and that truly was a doozy,0
i love this vid,0
honga tonga honga huhhhhwah,0
1 20 damn one day after i was born,0
,0
dayum,0
we got you on camera the camera 0 29,0
i cause tsunami myself in the bath tub it s pretty cool i think,1
i havnt realized just how powerful even a little 5 foot wave is until i went in the ocean one day and thought standing infront of one would be a good idea being able to knock around any person who just stands there without ducking under or anything these tsunamis really can just knock buildings out and toss cars around easily,1
i agree like how did onilink make this like how many triggers did this take,0
2 11 when an earthquake occurs far out in the ocean it allows the wave to travel for miles collecting more and more water as it goes oh is that what is happening the world is getting dumber,1
a wave is not known for forming out in open ocean it forms when it reaches shallow land waves like that are generated by other means,1
how can you estimate a number that specific,0
3 40 waves 130 ft high and reaching 400 mph absolute horseshit that is total nonsense and not accurate at all,1
new top 1,0
fr,0
feysteii yes,0
40 5 meters was the run up the actual wave was only about 10,1
tsunami 1 52 2 02 japanese seductive grunts,1
i live blocks away from the largest lake in idaho and we have records of 2 tsunamis in the past 200 years so they don t just happen in oceans,1
ive stumbled into the dumb part of youtube goodbye,0
im triangle angel of god there is a earthquake in the making off the coast of california stay away from the coast lines off the coast of california tsunami warning,1
on the fifth the video you can see the rest in the background,0
i forgot what the video was about you talk too much just show the videos,0
w wow this is really scary and yeah,0
i wish these guys would be realistic about tsunami s a tsunami is not so much a tidal wave as it more likely is a tidal bore for example he says the this tsunami was estimated fancy word for guessed to be 40 5 meters or rather 133 ft tall wave that s roughly equivalent to a 13 story building that just wasn t seen even that wave that the coast guard cutter motored over was more like in the range of 30ft instead you saw a very large tidal bore that kept coming and coming i think the highest wave was measured at about 60ft the vast majority of waves were more in the range of 20 30ft that s not to say that this wasn t a disaster in the making it was it just not as sensationalist to say such things as a wave is as tall as a big building,1
of 2011 on japan 9 2 earthquake 30 feet tsunami,1
40 meters sounds like extreme embellishment,0
tidal wave song from geometry dash starts playing,1
shiawase v i p,0
there were no tsunami warnings sirens,1
pov ur trying to find an comments that doesn t says waves tsunami,1
show me one 5 wave in this vid tsunami s are surges of water not gigantic waves,1
so fucking fake,0
gurl,0
you bright side or the 1f,0
you forget indian ocean tsunami 2004 im sri lanka,1
tsnaumis are terrifying,0
the one factor which didn t get enough coverage was the speed of the waves when they hit land the films show land getting flooded and some strength enough to push cars around but you did mention in the beginning of the video the speed of the water but then forgot to continue to emphasize that fact and in these areas susceptible to tsunami s do the building have protection from being swept away,1
brought to you by the us federal government oops i mean my pillow,0
good thing the japanese ship didn t pull a poseidon adventure maneuver,0
5 09 woman chilling and touring as tsunami wave arrives,1
remember the cameraman never dies,0
alternate title barely any video evidence of monster tsunami waves what a huge disappointing video where are these 30 40 ft waves idgaf to see two feet of water traveling on a fuckin parking lot,1
he fucking shook the camera the whole time terrible,0
could you imagine living in a place where you just casually watch another million gallons of water flowing towards you like no big deal just another day,0
why do they always show sunamis as giant 100 foot waves or bigger biggest film i ve ever seen is bout normal wave size or bigger,1
sensationalism however google lituya bay tsunami tho,1
it went throught the wave so smoothly,1
for a second there i thought that was cartoony,0
far out to sea is where you want to meet a tsunami,1
yep,0
true bc the tsunami is small at the time,1
lemonman r4v yep,0
yeah because it gets bigger the further it goes right,0
jonahdelagarde9807 close but not exactly it gets bigger the shallower the water out at sea the water is deepest,0
keepdancingmaria oh okay thanks,0
keepdancingmaria right regular tsunamis are little more than shockwaves in the open ocean they don t become large waves until the shockwave slows down the sea floor gets shallower and the water gets pushed upwards huge waves far out to sea are either rogue waves storm waves or mega tsunamis the latter of which would have traveled from somewhere close to a shore and caused by a landslide or some huge underwater disturbance,1
just wait till an asteroid hits the ocean we will see a real tsunami then,1
wow number 3 video of water up to peoples calves incredible,0
i think you should use a different description how can anyone enjoy this video,0
5 05 dude doesn t care,0
my ass on a surfboard lol,0
imagine swimming when you get pulled like a mile in to the ocean then turning around to a giant wave that s about to swallow you,1
this reminds me that there are genuinely people out there that are so stupid that they stand there on the beach with their phones out recording it when the ocean recedes stupidity that means you deserve to die atp natural selection,0
tectonic plate shift aka nuclear bomb exploded deep underwater you d be horrified just how many natural disasters were purposely man made,1
a tsunami can occur anywhere you have a body of water tsunamis are also a transfer of energy not water this narrator is very wrong about tsunamis,1
only issue i have with this are all the images of large breaking waves tsunamis like hurricane storm surge are long wave rises in water level not giant breaking surf on the beachhead,1
tsunami s are beautiful,1
the worse tsunami is the cause by land slide because they can be big and the land slide can provoke a flow of air forcing the water in one way,1
the guy in the first video going ooooohhh waaahhhhhooooo is the proper reaction to that shit lol,0
2 stories is about 20ft so if 20ft of water hits say goodbye to the average home nature doesnt play around,0
how was the 2004 boxing bay tsunami not on this list by far the worst in recent memory with very sobering footage of the giant waves coming to share with helpless people still on the beach,1
too much talking show the footage and shut up,0
finally a video that doesnt clickbait the thumbnail,0
lol fr,0
i highly doubt said waves reach 400 some mph that absurd,1
woman wears mask because authorities told her to but doesn t speed up her casual stroll at all to escape the rapidly rising water,1
perhaps because no authorities told her to pick up her pace if authorities didn t mandate the mask she probably would ve taken her chances with covid as well,0
its hard to imagine how powerful these waves are when looking at them it isn t until you witness them pushing cars around like toys that you start to get an idea of their force,1
true but cars become more buoyant when windows are closed this makes it much easier for the water to push the cars around a concrete block is much harder to move compared to an air filled car,0
you ve clearly never seen me at the gym bro,0
senator don t be a cornball,0
doesnt matter what have seen on line there is nothing have ever seen quite like tsunami,1
can you just stop speaking and play the video,0
after watching this video im convinced that real tsunamis don t exist you never actually see a tsunami wave or a wave crashing on shore like a movie or something it s literally just a big ass flood there is no wave or wave crash on shore the wave is in the ocean but it never crashes or has the effect of actual wave crash that does damage if someone can stand on the beach itself filming a video saying look at the tsunami as only water rushes towards them like a flood that s not a tsunami wave at 9 30 it said footage of a wave hitting the cars there was no actual wave it literally only showed water flooding in the rough of it and no wave at all all the footage in this video showed water flooding none of a actual ginormous wave crashing on shore like you believe a real tsunami wave would do stop calling these tsunamis make a word for giant flood because that s all these were,1
prove me wrong and show me footage of a giant ass however many foot wave actually crashing on shore and destroying a city i would love to see it because if your filming a tsunami and can still see the horizon line in the ocean there is no wave just floods,1
how you left out the indonesia tsunami in 2004 boggles the mind research a bit more when you do these videos,1
your 3 tsunami has to be one of the saddest examples particularly as it follows the 3 11 11 japan tsunami with 20 000 deaths and entire cities wiped out i particularly like the elderly woman meandering down the alley as the ankle deep water pushes on through,1
monster waves really freaking drama queen,1
most dangerous hello i hope everything is well can you please list the track and artist of the song that is playing 4 53 it would be much appreciated,1
this channel is copying underworld very accurate,0
the waves traveled at speeds nearing 700 km h how does this reconcile with the slow ass wave the ship rolled over in the video you can t just say something like that and not explain more,1
will if you re getting disaster after disaster then build differently rebuilding the same way thinking different out come is insane,1
the people who just casually continued walking as the water flooded i would freak out even if it didn t get crazy high or fast,1
no one gona talk about that person who walks from the tsunamis like it s noting,1
he was like ugh this sh t agaun,0
i m glad i live in western pennsylvania far away from the flat tornado lands and the oceans,0
1 39 is not a tsunami tsunamis take 20 minutes to go under a ship these are surface waves that go under the ship in a few seconds not tsunamis,1
i think it s impossible for the average person to understand tsunamis are not high waves they are long waves they are 500 miles long even a 5 foot tsunami can flood a town,1
did the coast guard call it in ohhh hell not or thee athoaridies release the worning ohhhhh hell no,0
i like how he said it collects more water from where i mean it s not technically collecting more water it s using the water the sea has it s not like the sea said we should go collect a lake,0
the power of those three waves alone could probably create enough energy to light the world for 1000 years,1
there is a japanese movie about the heroic efforts to save the nuclear power plant i forgot the name,1
masturbations,0
i dont believe the estimates of how high some of these are i mean come on 40 metres high that is over 100 feet ffs the waves on these videos were no more than 30 feet at most i think they exaggerate a lot,1
ooooo gojira,0
too bad lisa page and peter strock wasn t in the fbi building that would have been entertaining,0
but but but climate change,0
i fished the north sea during storm months for lobster shrimp and crab sometimes we d get tossed around by waves 40 feet high plenty of guys were puking below deck and some of them even pooped themselves or peed a little,1
that drunk old woman gave no f s lol,0
clickbait the first picture that you see on this yt add is altered and fake,0
the tsunami is when the wave reaches mainland not the wave itself but only when it crashes the wave in the ocea is called a tidal wave,1
it s not the stage of the wave that defines its name but the cause tidal waves are caused by ocean tides i e the moon and wind a tsunami is most often caused by an earthquake or asteroid if your name is barney but is created at source and remains a tsunami until it s energy expires usually as it hits land,1
kinda like the difference between asteroids and meteorites cool,0
why is there an fbi office on the american samoa,0
sew narmi is qiut p w ph,0
camera man never dies,0
the quality of that fbi cam,0
8 46 date and year is fine but when you re at it please note the magnitude also,0
7 27 i m impressed that she never sounded hysterical in any way,0
regrow the mangrove forests what else is there to say,0
that really wouldn t be a tsunami wave a tsunami wave out to see is traveling upwards of 500 mph assuming that large of a ship is out in deep water the wave height of a tsunami would be very low because the wave length from peak to peak is so far apart in deep water the ship wouldn t even have noticed it only when it comes in to contact with the land does the wave slow down and start to get taller please get facts correct before posting,1
always with the fake pics of towering crests hitting a beach which never happens in real life ever,0
how do you know that,0
it s like the whole ocean rises often they not gigantic waves but the pressure and height of the whole ocean brings a terrible force,1
nicholasforman1195 because there are geological records of mega tsunamis based on the damage they ve caused to coastlines that was left behind most tsunamis express as a series of inrushing ocean surges not gigantic one off breakers those are mega tsunamis and they re almost always caused by huge cliff collapses underwater explosive eruptions or else asteroid impacts they don t get caused by earthquakes alone,1
go live in japan when one of the tsunami s hit then tell me they don t come crashing to shore,1
so you know all this is fake how,0
dudenjill1 coz it never happens duh,0
sjacrane you have proof it never happens then i suppose japan was just joking when they got hit then,0
dudenjill1 do you possess reading comprehension skills i never said tsunamis never happen or happened i said the ones depicted in movies with towering crests the walls of water never fkn happen,1
actually there is a video on youtube showing the wall of water behind a bridge if i can find it i will post a link,0
sjacrane why yes i do apparently you don t have any comprehension skills you said it was fake did you explain further nope but apparently i and everyone else was supposed to know what you meant there are actual videos of walls of water hitting shore but you don t actually like inform yourself before you speak,0
there are great documentaries of the one that hit thailand years back and yes it was at least a 40 to 50 wave that went right over everything only the people on rooftops of multi storied buildings were spared,1
https youtu be nj mr3p8 dg si b2px9yxysaohg2d,0
ain t nobody tryna hear all that extra shit just show the shit going down,0
people who can t swim would die thank you all for watching,0
it s impossible to swim against the current of a tsunami plus once it makes landfall it s full of debris that can crush people,1
even swimmers can die in tsunamis the force of the water and the debris that it s carrying can kill people,1
its terrifying to think the reason they look relatively tame from these videos is because most people who witnessed the worst of it died,0
no doubt a most unpleasant and bowel content evicting experience rather like waking up to discover biden at the helm,0
the 2011 tsunami was additionally empowered by under water land slides this is why many areas they were larger than anticipated,1
i m got a bungalow now we need to know that s so we need to see that so we need a car so we need to rap i cannot overlike a size and i note the next soccer do you like you organised a scott the dad who buys cupcake dubabout you buy it to skip down,0
uneventful video more bark than bite and you leave out 2004,0
those aren t mountains they re waves,1
in the first clip the fence is a actual chad,0
why is the volcano called honga tanga tanga honga bonga,0
hunga tonga hunga ha apai,0
no one enjoys such videos i found it informative thanks,0
i enjoyed it,0
how is japan not number 1 on this list compared to the japan tsunami the others on the list seemed like nothing,1
i wonder how those 3 feet high high deep water tsunamis always look like they are 200 feet high,1
landslide also cause tsunami s,1
out of all the actual monster wave footage out there these are the 4 you choose to highlight in a video the first one ok but come on man i ve had bigger waves in my bathtub yawn,1
clickbait trash your thumbnail says it all,0
wait if the wave travels at 500miles an hour why didn t it pass the boat at high speed they watched it lift the boat and roll under it,1
sorry but what about the 2004 boxing day tsunami i was fully expecting it to be in the no 1 spot,1
the number 3 ranked tsunami in this video seems sketchy monster really,1
thanks god we arabs live in the desert,0
the uae is situated right at the epicenter of an open ocean so let one asteroid or comet smack the ocean like that s it you re done for no more united arab emirates,0
this video sucks no mention of the catastrophic devastating tsunami that hit indonesia but they show the relatively minor tsunamis that occurred in turkey and tonga what is more the footage this video uses is pretty lame there are much better tsunami videos on youtube than this one don t waste your time,1
we should be able to harvest the tsunami energy this would mean energy reservation for many many months or years for a territory,1
very interesting three of these i didn t know of one clip that depicts the unimaginable size of a mega tsunami is from omoe in japan it reached a height of 40 5 meters the insane power of mother nature is second to none love the fact that you showed clips that are less frequent here on youtube,1
the height was watermarks on hillsides outside seawalls water collecting on the outside not wave height afaik,1
scientists now know the tonga volcano was caused by a caldera collapse at one point the wave was 65 ft high or 19 812 meters,1
i was in environmental sciences in college and nobody ever really mentions that the wave slowes down get pushed up buy land and then waves behind it start catching up so there are multiple reasons the wave builds but tsunamis are fascinating my favorite natural disaster,1
that was boring,0
my mom was in the boxing day tsunami thank god she survived,1
i think someone is pulling your leg with the name of the invisible under water volcano called honga tonga mek a hiny ho,0
mek a hiny ho i am dying,0
you can never go wrong showing the clips in their entirety without a single spoken word,0
i live beside the faultline in new zealand running up the southern alps will be a megathrust when it goes scientists predict over mag 9 and tsunami we are apparently overdue,1
well this was crap how the hell is turkey even in this,0
9 0 is pronounced nine point zero not nine point oh oh and zero are two different characters look at your keyboard and try to inter an oh instead of a zero doesn t work get educated,0
honga honga tonga tonga tonga sounds like a funny name ngl,0
what s even worse about that 2011 tsunami is the nuclear plant meltdown that is still to this day spewing radiation into the ocean and the atmosphere radiation levels from said disaster here in the us are over 500 x s the acceptable limit and slowly rising any concerns or questions just talk to anybody that was in the pacific ocean fishing industry did ya ll ever wonder what happened to the show deadliest catch,1
the radiated crab are on the other side of the russian line,0
inside of business and inside of home,0
before i saw tsunami but it was small so i walked through it but it kinda burnt my arm,1
,0
the second video recorded in 2020 only had camera angles of a street someone s business and some other crap where are good tsunami videos i swear tsunamis are pussies i hear people say they as big as buildings and other stuff and i never see it,1
40m waves go fish,1
none of the individual wave hitting japan were much over eight feet at most it is just that the ocean was also rising backing up that eight feet the total height the ocean got to was probably not over 30 to 40 feet at most in the bays i watched every video put up on the web when that happened none got to the height you stated in yards,1
2 04 2 08 you re my sexy juice taco,0
can you just speed it up a wee bit,0
face red droopy eyes what planet,0
reminds me of what god told us in 2 chronicles 7 14 if the nation follows and obeys god these things just don t happen one of gods promises to us,0
hmmm does that piece of scripture refer to healing the land itself or healing the people of the land,0
it doesn t bring water from the ocean to the land it transfers the energy along the water the water doesn t really move as far as the energy does in a realistic scenario models of tidal wave motions show that the energy of your average tidal wave draws a circle with the water particles all while transferring the energy a huge wave such as a tsunami is caused by a large amount of energy caused by something like a 9 0 earthquake seen far off shore off japan making the water draw larger circles this video explains what i m trying to explain in greater detail https www youtube com watch v 4nhyuhhh59g,1
why does the emoting of japanese men always sound like someone vomiting,0
idiotic not one wave just flooding,1
we just wanted to see them not listen to your ramblings,0
and our government is even worse in the damage they cause,0
movie or in real life made or making of the evil scientist here in the philippines from a long long time ago until now paki translate lang po pls thank you po kung totoo at tunay po kayong lahat na maka god po ay maniniwala po kayo sa amin,0
this video was before 2023,0
this video didn t include two tsunamis that happened in the modern past and one in the distant past one in the recent past is up in alaska where it was caused by a underground landslide which slammed the tsunami into a bay and i can t remember the name of the bay the other was across the atlantic ocean caused by an underground landslide possibly from or during a earthquake,1
because latoya bay wasn t caught on camera and it happened in the bay,0
tsunamis give me diarrhea from my peehole,1
q 1 look,0
those people running for their lives from an oncoming tsunami wearing covid face diapers the true power of propaganda is astounding,1
bro kinda predicted the turkey earthquake,1
translate 1 39 3 22 for english 1 39 i don t know 1 47 10 it will 10 meters tall 2 03 12 secondly tsunami will coming soon both engines get 12 degrees thrust or 12 levels this order how should moves their engines but i don t know about the ship so i can t make exactly translation 2 10 4 5 4 5 miles away the secondly tsunami wave from us 2 49 ah can you see that nah tsunami is climbing dike and it may be get over dike 2 57 yeah see you later maybe someone called him ah it s getting over the dike getting over now 3 02 can you see this site finally secondly tsunami wave gets over the dike and flooding it s a ter terribly current 3 10 ah the car is washing away washing away 3 17 can you see that more and more sea water has flowing here 3 20 ah no wait jcg s crew could survived this tsunami but i don t know survived or washed away the newscaster i m sure run away from seaside or riverside or climb tall buildings a soon as possible after big earthquake for example shaking more longer than 1 minute but if you on the ship when you faced tsunami you must run into tsunami 90 degree angle and climb it maximum speed it is only way to survive on the ship and this means saved many ships please remember,1
i dont get why i always read about the wave traveling at 450 mph we have footage of it it crawls at like 10 20 mph are they just referring to like the very moment of impact at the tectonic plate or something for like a split second both in the ocean and on land we have footage of it 10 20 mph the whole way so huh,1
the fbi office deserved it,0
i want to know why you left out the indian ocean tsunami,1
what the hell is a 9 ooh earthquake,1
can t tsunamis also be caused by landslides or is that considered a consequence of an earthquake or volcano,1
ofcourse i don t know much about landslides tsunami but sometimes it will be very tall one of them was more higher than 500 meters and i heard submarine volcano eruption caused tsunami as tall as great east japan earthquake,1
yes that s what happened in lituya sp bay ak in 1958,0

the boxing day 2004 tsunami never happend this is not a complete doc,1
turkey now suffered another big tragedy you mentioned that country properly,0
i thought that ships in deep water would hardly notice a tsunami passing under them,1
report faker,0
plenty mouthtart no info dis,0
no one needs feet meter centimeter is way better and usa is the only land that uses it so why do u say feet,0
haarp,0
just saw a episode of doreamon about a monster tsunami,1
that first wave doesn t necessarily look impressive but considering the depth of water they are probably in and how thick that wave was that was an enormous amount of energy that just passed under that boat hopefully they immediately got on the radio after that and told the shore to evacuate because there is a mountain of water coming your way,1
japan does have a history of tsunami s even being recorded as far back as the 8th century or 9000s ace but they don t usually amount to high damages in death tolls since those who stay choose to stay but those who are smart know they have to leave so the most damages are usually just in building and house damage i think most have tsunami and earthquake insurance in japan simply because the only way to prepare for that kind of thing is to warn them when it s coming and to get out of there but also as an aftermath kinda thing most will get earthquake insurance if their property is damaged or lost,1
lituya bay mega tsunami be like why won t you include me,1
zaynes5094 why do you believe that apostrophes play a part in plurals,0
roasterbaby777 be like try to use your words like a grown up,0
markfox1545 maybe i can use memes,0
jesus loves you,0
knowing the wave is likely to pass under if you re set properly to go over it i d still shit my jimmie knowing an incalculable amount of weight water and power just passing by like the power of god passing over you,1
markfox1545 we get it you are insecure and think you can prop yourself up by going on a mini comment spree correcting people s grammar punctuation and or spelling here s the thing though no one cares i too wish more people had proper respect for language but this is youtube not a fucking term paper calm down get a life maybe walk away from the internet for a while and go touch some grass besides why do you think you needn t capitalize the first word of a sentence nor put someone s direct quote in quotation marks when you try to smugly correct them because you think it ll make strangers on the interwebs think you are big smart,0
kevenough very different because youncan see hear feel and measure real stuff,0
roasterbaby777 no fun for you kind sir,0
massive storms make waves,1
they can t have i think because the warning come when the water was right in near the town people were still walking,1
norml hugh mann yeah like god cool talk,0
which is one reason i don t understand people who say they would buy their own island and live there if they came into money can you imagine if somone was on a tiny island in the middle of the pacific and these types if waves are coming at you 100 to 200 ft tall it s all over if tie on that island say good bye never live in a island if you had money,1
yes the amazing power of jehovah god almighty yes jehovah can cause an earthquake on ocean floor causing a massive tidal wave huge massive wave awesome isn t it no god can match jehovah god almighty,1

the earthquake in japan was caused by the us navy dropping two large nuclear weapons on their fault line they did it to force japan into the us federal reserve banking system japan was a rich country before that their like everyone else now flat broke,1
sorry can t handle that voice,0
scary and sad,0
tsunamis are horrific yet tital surge of 18 feet for nine hours straight from hurricane ian destroyed coastal properties and ravaged inland communities for up to 5 miles from the shorelines,1

by the underwater valcano named insert incomprehensible unga bunga name here that was the best part of the video without question way better than the little half a foot tall waves squirting over some barriers and the slideshow of some cars getting pushed or the full 10 minutes of cgi normal views with shaking affects added in or educational content the boat riding over a medium sized wave was a close second though but none of this justifies the video being named monster tsunami waves caught on camera if it was honest it d be titlted floods caused by waves caught on camera they reaaaaally did their best to stretch out this video to 10 minutes to get them midrolls huh,1

to be honest the so called tsunami that hit tonga wonga tonga what ever cannot be compared with what japan went through if japan was hit with that tsunami they would of only lost three people,1
can anyone translate what is spoken in japanese in this video,0
i will ride a boat,0
u forgot to say due to the 2011 tsunami it s caused a nuclear meltdown and the near death of 80 000 people if it completed blew up and their was also a whirlpool,1

respect to the boat for being in the tsunami,1
lol where on earth did you hear that tsunamis at sea collect more and more water as they travel they absolutely do not gather anything as they travel throughout the open ocean the one thing and indeed the only thing that a tsunami does is alter the height of the water through which the wave propagates there are two component concepts to understand tsunami action in the open ocean energy density and group velocity when the velocity is high the energy density is low in the open ocean the wave s energy has a lot of space to spread out which reduces the energy density of the wave that increases its speed crucially none of the water molecules travel with the wave rather the wave travels through them and they merely serve as the medium consider a sound wave and a piece of wood if someone is on one end of a board and another on the other side and one of them taps the end the pieces of wood from his end do not travel with the sound wave rather the sound wave use the molecules in the wood to propagate through as the wave front approaches shallower water the energy that was previously spread out deep to the ocean floor no longer has the same space available and the energy in the wave therefore begins to become more and more compressed the same time the wave front slows down and the water is elevated by the upward motion of the energy being reflected off of the sea floor since the amount of energy to be dissipated doesn t change until it has something to absorb it a slower speed means that water level has to rise to compensate for there being more energy per unit volume this is technically known as wave shoaling the energy available per unit volume can displace a given quantity of water which will be higher than the surrounding water levels this repeats and repeats as the bottom surface is shallower and shallower until such time as things begin to be moved in such fashion that they no longer return to their original position this tendency of water particles to not be carried with the wave is called its free orbital motion it moves in happy little circles when a wave propagates through its region it goes up a bit in one direction falls and back in the opposite direction where it stops at its original position when that is unbalanced by high energy density waves in shallow water you these molecules no longer return to their original position they are then transformed into translational motion and gets moving forward and taking everything it can with it this is because the seafloor is not infinitely far away and because water is not perfectly incompressible under those conditions the motion would satisfy a degenerate case of orbital motion it s a technical point that s not worth saying more on other than noting that i m perfectly well aware of the underlying physics and actual motion in the real world and why reality doesn t perfectly follow mathematical modeling,1

the tonga eruption i live on the east coast of new zealand and i heard the shock waves in the hills sounded like a truck rolling over in the hills a loud booming noise,1
btw on 2 the volcanic eruption was so strong it triggered tsunami advisories in japan the shockwave from the eruption was heard as far as alaska yeah almost 10 000 km away,1

cool video nature aint no joke also avalanches can cause very quick and deadly tsunamis in inland lakes with very high sides all around that is some crazy video,1

you forgot to mention the boxing day tsunami in 2004 in the indian ocean it was one of the deadliest tsunamis on record killing over 200 000 people some estimates are as high as 250 000,1
i think it was the most deadliest,1
sirkolass i said 200 000 to 250 000 people not feet the tsunami was 40 meters or 131 feet,1
that sunami hit seychelles,0
i was just a kid but i remember being so shocked by the waves that i was worried that my coastal town several thousand miles away would be flooded really don t know why he didn t include that one,1
was is caught on camera though,0
how could the boxing day tsunami not be number one,1
krimson1958 it was there is alot of videos depicting that day even the earthquake before the tsunami events was recorded but be advised there is alot of people getting caught by the waves and water and some videos you can even see the dead people being dragged a horrible day indeed,1
jesus is coming back soon start believing before its too late,0
dazai de harlequin jesus is coming back soon start believing before its too late,0
this is just a pathetic video anyone of us could have done a better job,0
but was it all caught on camera,0
doughboi007 yes it was well documented and filmed from many angles,0
they had no tsunami warning system japan had an excellent one,1
jade harris is it contest,0
jesuschristwon every soul is eternal that is our birthright we are his children,0
that lady in turkey didn t look too concerned about the tsunami,1
right that was probably the worst in modern history,0
jesuschristwon belief through fear don t think jesus would be impressed,0
rayson700 jesus loves you and he s proud of you start believing before it s too late ask for forgiveness of your sins before it s too late,0
yeah it even affected australia a little bit too i think we were the least affected by it i m not sure my heart goes out to the families of all those who died on that tragic day what a horrible horrible thing to happen to so many lovely people,0
dazai de harlequin sorry,0
that s been covered to death,1
krimson1958 yep,0
day after xmas for us heathens and mericans,0
i ve just spent a few weeks traveling the andaman coast of thailand really brings it home when you see tsunami evacuation routes,1
it was the deadliest not the most powerfull,1
only in sumatra over 120000 all over the indian ocean more then 230000 very fast and aggressive tsunamis,1
i have read a book about that it is called tara and the towering wave read it,1
jesuschristwon bahahahaha i thought he came back every easter yall will say some fantastical shit,0
erk350 jesus is coming back to gather all the people that believe in him and then they will go to heaven he loves you and cares for you,0
jesuschristwon i will believe when i see it until then it s a nice story,0
thats kinda why i came here is to see that footage,0
erk350 there is proof in the bible this world didn t just create itself the lord created it he has a purpose for you he loves you sm and he s trying to tell you that,0
yes 35meter high waves,1
oh ya i learned about that one in school apparently the reason so many people died that day was because a majority of the people lived right next to the ocean,0
that s becouse the deserts are flat,0
jesuschristwon that god is an evil jerk if he exist i doubt he does because he wouldn t allow blunders of scientific errors throughout the bible,0
jesuschristwon you are not god stop trying to predict what jesus himself doesn t even know if you claim to know when jesus comes back you in fact are putting yourself above him he could be here tomorrow or 3 000 years from now go home and rethink your strategy cause you re not helping your cause,0
shushyshushy6762 i m not god i m spreading the gospel in fact jesus says that he will come back soon i don t know when but he said soon jesus loves you,0
jesuschristwon in your own words taken from your comment from 2 months ago jesus is coming back soon start believing before its too late that is fear mongering that is not the gospel you are a false christ a false prophet you are not benefiting the kingdom of god you are ruining it you are destroying the image of god by using that tactic,1
shushyshushy6762 we have to warn people of the rapture but i hope you know that jesus loves you and he cares for you,0
jesuschristwon you re not warning anyone of anything people have been screaming this shit from the mountain tops long before you ever did and because nothing happens or things settle down people stop listening to fools like you ultimately fools like you damage the reputation of christianity and people leave or stop believing because they can no longer trust the words that are falling out of your mouth you aren t doing god any favors just damaging his name and the reputation of believers everywhere,1
thats its not tsunami but a bomb,1
how was the boxing day tsunami forgotten,1
erk350 since you mentioned the most powerful why is one in turkey even listed in this video,0
jesuschristwon do the amazonians believe in your god even though they were here long before any of that stuff,0
erk350 ik jesus is real and he s king,0
jesus loves you sm,0
i don t think this was a ranking just a list everyone knows about that tsunami so it s good to hear about a different one once in awhile,1
it s a day i ll never forget,0
snarkysharky7913 i did not know abt it,0
chucknorris277 yes boxing day is british,0
daveador876 did you enjoy thailand,0
erk350 no easter is a celebration of jesus s rising from the dead and going to heaven to be with his dad god,1
yeah that and 2011 japan tsunami are burned in my mind,1
i don t think he forgot it does say caught on camera,0
jesuschristwon stop with the spam,0
oof,0
jesuschristwon yeah i don t think i need to ask a random palestinian guy who s been dead for 2000 years for forgiveness that doesn t make much sense does it,1
jesuschristwon shhhhh it s not real,0
colinschmidt3475 no jesus is alive and jesus is coming back soon he s in heaven and he is going to take everyone who loves him with all of there heart and soul to heaven with him,0
dazaideharlequin7424terrorist then,0
we dont have cameras on 2004 i think,0
sooo who s black jesus then,0

samsmom1491 yes jesus is coming back,0
it affected japan too,0
krimson1958 nope,0
jesuschristwon i heard about this prediction that s been going on from 1914 1925 1975 the generation of 1914 that will not pass we re in 2023 the overlapping generation in 2010 and now we re in the final last of the final last days shortly before the final last days it still hasn t happened yet,0
fadedinsandiego2025 jesus is coming,0
i picked it up and put it in a box,0
krimson1958 yes hundreds of times,0
its not a high one its fast,0
was it recorded,0
,0
yeah,0
this video actually shows the scale of the wave that hits its how you d imagine the tsunami to look like in a holywood disaster film usually it s a wall of water that s not actually that high but relentless as the energy behind it is insane this is both and is utterly mental https youtu be rdouwmj7xzo si b oftf1xbksvwbn3,1
that s what the movie the impossible is based on right,0
most deadliest but not the biggest the biggest was lithua bay in alaska which was almost as tall as the biggest building in the world,1
garysorley69 and the sea walls took a lot of the energy away,0
amazing how they didn t mention that one it was horrific,0
2004 aceh indonesia,0
jesus christ won is probably one of these idiots that believes trump won as well,0
some estimate isn t at all an accurate account and it sounds like you re copying and pasting straight from a wikipedia page,0
jesuschristwon don t be spamming your religious nonsense on here kid nobody believes those childish mythology tales,0

lordofthepancakes i do and jesus loves all of us and that s the truth he is real,0
jesuschristwon it s not real kid it s just a story invisible sorcerers don t exist in real life,0
shushyshushy6762 bro he s coming soon,0
lordofthepancakes it s real omg,0
was it recorded no,0
niccilupia fz4lh such a smartass for reason other than to be nasty there have been tsunamis long before we were around to record them into the history books no,1
jesuschristwon jesus is not god he is a human and messenger of god,0
it was posted 2 years ago,0
h1zen340 jesus is in fact god the trinity is the father son and holy sprit so jesus is god and 3 in 1 jesus wasn t just a messenger of god and we know this from numerous facts but here is one that really proves that jesus was the son of god jesus fulfilled more than 300 prophesies which is impossible for a human messenger to do,0
it s because this is an american clip made for an american audience most americans don t know where the indian ocean is,0
how could they forget that one,0
maryannewhite3620 no way,0
maryannewhite3620 is the one bigger than that,0
maryannewhite3620 tsunami,1
incredible footage it s haunting to witness nature s raw power these tsunamis truly show the ultimate force of our planet,1
actually the lituya bay incident was more powerful it didn t kill as many people but it would have been the deadliest,1
nyctrafn yes that was a huge tsunami probably the highest wave height in modern history it s been called a mega tsunami i think it was from a landslide,1
yes 1000 of sri lankan people lost their lives,0
colinadkinss,0
not being a nerd but he said caught on camera,0
the boxing day tsunami was definitely caught on camera there s footage of the first waves coming on shore and much more,1
your wrong it s the mega tsunami it was 70 feet,1
where exactly,0
the 12 26 2004 tsunami is the deadliest on record,1
krimson1958 there are many videos of the 12 26 2004 tsunami i m surprised that you haven t seen any of them and they re dramatic,1
actually it was way overblown as far as the death toll 10 000 fatalities at most the tsunami at rehoboth beach delaware was far worse,1
the boxing day tsunami was not only the deadliest but the biggest range of spread and destruction,1
,0
yes i believe they even showed footage of it in the intro,0
to late then,0
yeah duh everyone knows that,0
did they box ok that day,0
xxxx,0
i cant believe that tsunami is so powerfull i hope that the horses are ok,1
omg that is crazy,0
they occur near plate boundaries so if your in the center or really far away from them you are safe from tsunamis like africa,1
just show me the wave in the start of video instead of explanation,1
i always remember the heartbreaking moment 2 horses were in a large field and were running from the tsunami and then got to the fence and couldn t escape terribly sad,1
sounds more funny than heartbreaking,0
justgre3d yes i ll be laughing when your miserable existence is ending tragically as well,0
thetheraine be my guest i have no idea who you are so i could care less about your laugh out of 7 billion people chances are you d die before me i m pretty young,0
justgre3d yeah young and dumb with an attitude that is dragging the world down but when you do get older you will be living in the mess you created enjoy,0
thetheraine i m not dragging the world down i m an insignificant speck on this planet who contributes nothing more or less when i get older i ll live my life and if i do get in a mess it won t be because of my own creation,0
justgre3d init tho,0
gabriela pretty damn funny to me maybe we have different sense of humor,0
gabriela i don t think age really matters when it comes to sense of humor but since you want to know i am 16 and as to why it makes me laugh i don t know i just think it s funny i don t think before i laugh i just do it,0
gabriela greed and samantha are obviously of a generation where empathy compassion kindness love and care for fellow living things is non existent god help us,0
gabriela guess i m immature then,0
gabriela greed and samantha are godless that s the real spiritual issue in todays world,0
how tall is this fence you re speaking of 10ft 20ft these must have been the only 2 horses who couldn t jump either way hopefully the fence kept them in their pasture,0
thetheraine lmao never seen this comment but yeah i am godless i couldn t give a shit about nonexistent things,0
it is funny it s funny that you would comment about 2 horses and how sad that was but don t mention a word about the thousands of human lives lost you re what s wrong with the world not the 16 yr old that s being a 16 yr old,0
supremoqueefer it s symbolic of what happened seeing the terror of 2 horses running for their lives and then a fence stops them their lives ended if you have no empathy for what those 2 horses felt you will certainly not care about the thousands of humans that died you are what is wrong with the world and the stupid 16 year olds that laugh that s a good indication of the lack of love compassion and empathy in human hearts for humans animals the planet sad,0
justgre3d i really like that your coping mechanism for having no friends is attempting to sound like a deep intelligent sinister person but its okay you re still pretty young some things may change or remain the same,0
maximany9506 actually i m school hanging out with my friends rn at lunch lol don t push your insecurities on me tho,0
justgre3d i dont think that merely being around your classmates in school is considered a friendship but you can delude yourself if you wish to anyways i just want to ask you something and i won t bother you anymore are you an american or european or whatever,0
maximany9506 i m guessing that s how your school life was following around classmates pretty damn sad like i said don t push what happened to you onto me only making yourself look like a fool here,0
justgre3d sure and ill choose to believe you now would you like to answer my question,0
maximany9506 i m american,0
justgre3d oh okay,0
supremoqueefer why would you think that human s lifes are more valueable than animal s lifes humans destroy earth animals don t,1
justgre3d it definitely would have been funny if justgre3d was the one running and trapped by the fence,0
lisakabula891 i wouldn t usually find myself in those types of situations,0
there are some animals who destroy the ecosystem too but it isnt as bad like how we are destroying it schnuffeltuch6,1
i hope that lady in turkey survived the water there she did not really seem to have a sense of urgency at all,0
it really is a miracle that more people did not die in the fukushima tsunami i know any loss of life due to a natural disaster is horrible and i do not discount the horrible loss of life in japan,1
fukushima is just the name of one of the many cities that were bit by the japan tsunami,1
i died in a tsunami and was rescued and brought back to shore by a dolphin,1

monster tsunami waves caught on camera is the title then they show no 2 and say thankfully it went no deeper than this all a couple of feet or words to that effect lol,1
the frozen video pic of a ship s bow and a giant wave with the caption under it declaring tsunami is misleading at sea a tsunami would be barely detectable and moving at hundreds of miles per hour it s only when they reach shallower water and beaches do they rise up and become prominent what is pictured in 5he advertisement for the clip is a rogue wave or similar,1
make the seawall higher,0
not a single good video mehh,0
a long time ago i used to have dreams that looked like that part where the boat goes over that tsunami wave except there was never a boat just me floating in the water near the shore and then all of a sudden the water swells and rises uncontrollably and floods inland over everything all land would just suddenly disappear below the water and i would be struggling to stay afloat surrounded by nothing but huge waves of water,1
me too i would be out in the water somewhere and just see what looked like the horizon darkening scary,0
you should see that guy in vienna freud i think his name is i think he d be interested in hearing about this,0
sri lanka sumatra was the worst one in my lifetime more than a quarter of a million people died,0
japan 19k deaths,1
i m glad i don t live down on that end just scary,0
i thought australian woman in tonga was going to start telling us how indigenous populations are more susceptible to tsunamis than white people,1
on september 29 2009 two large earthquakes struck midway between samoa and american samoa a u s territory the earthquakes generated tsunami waves of up to 22 meters 72 feet that engulfed the shores killing at least 192 people 149 in samoa 34 in american samoa and 9 in niuatoputapu tonga,1

there s been something speaking growling snarling laughing with a d3monic sounding voice for almost the whole video i couldn t really understand what it was saying for most of it but at 25 07 it sounds like it says do you rrreally i have to loop it a few more times to try to figure out the rest of what it s saying edit i believe it s saying do you rrreally think you re not gonna di3 i have to alter the way i write certain words or my comment will be removed it s still talking and snarling after that really difficult to understand exactly what it s saying but i m sure it isn t nice i ll add more time stamps if it speaks loudly and clearly enough for everyone else to hear 27 09 you hear a small child sing song something in her language then you can hear shut up the bitch the last 2 words are loudest at 27 14 it s been adding its two cents in and snarling the whole time since the last time stamp but at 32 14 you can hear it s really getting fed up with them in its space so it shouts go lol the whole thing is blowing my mind from the fact this thing really exists and is talking to the fact it is speaking in english why is it speaking in english 44 32 a completely different entity is speaking i don t understand what it s saying typical ghost whisper 44 43 d3monic deep growl words followed by a growling inhale so deep i can t understand it the voice is like a growing lion mixed with a growling monster stereotypical d3mon,0
very interesting i have watched the majority of these videos over and over since 2011 and never heard what you have heard i do hear strange sounds though i am going to go back and listen for the things you heard people talk about the 2004 earthquake and tsunami being horrific which it was but it is nothing compared to this 2011 japan earthquake and tsunami over 25 000 people lost their lives or are still missing sending peace and love and safety and life from jesus christ our savior love from southern california,1
km mink i hear them fairly easily with these airpod pros i can hear them in any video they re talking in even movies and stuff these airpods have opened up a whole new world for me an interesting and somewhat terrifying world,0
45 20 the growling entity is now growl roar screaming sounds like a cheetah or something a large cat but not a very large cat lol idk how to explain it,0

then please explain why there is no visible 9 2 earthquake damage on bridges sea walls buildings power line poles etc just water damage without a 9 2 earthquake preceding this water event bull shit,1
the earth quake was miles away under water buildings were shaking etc but it was the ensuing tsunami that caused the damage,1
japan is known for their earthquakes and thus there is very strict rules in how to build things they need to be able to withstand them only americans are stupid enough not to learn from their mistakes they keep building shoebox houses in tornado prone areas they are stupid not the japanese,1
the town appears to have fully recovered amazingly today there is no sign of the destruction and it s full of cars and homes and businesses again and now they have a shopping mall,0
but they still are in dire need of young people moving there or the town will die out despite all their efforts,0
total devastation,0
poor filming to much moving around,0
i wonder if people felt health problems due to the problems with fokushima it gives hope that here are people shown who survived and how let s pray for the security of our japanese friends,0
was very cold out also to make chaos to havoc n death,1
water every life form on the planet needs it to survive when you see waters raw strength like this it is incredible i m sure after 13 years there is still a little physical clean up i m sorry for your loss if you lost loved ones the mental clean up is the hardest one,0

yeah they withstand the tsunami waves waters but they would not survive a tornado,1
what made me watch this was hearing about the earthquake in taiwan and that there was possibly a tsunami warning and everything and watching this devastation just breaks my heart all over again this is more devastating than watching all the tornadoes hit combined i m not saying tornadoes aren t heartbreaking to see but this is so much more on a larger scale,1

when the person with the camera walks out of the building and turns towards the front entrance at 53 35 on this video the banner on the wall reads 50 years since chile let s spread the word about earthquakes and tsunamis let s raise the fear of tsunamis disaster prevention awareness how ironic is that,1
definetly would have been a hard thing to imagine thank you for educational yet tragic information for some reason i tend to revisit every few years,0
i too revisit these videos from 2011 and now with the russian earthquake and tsunami i am rewatching some of these all over again i think i have seen most of them quite a few times i m fascinated by what was set in motion blessings peace to all,1
,0
i live in oregon my coast has mtns for protection it always seems to feel a lil dangerous just to visit the coast,1
true but that ends up making the river beds susceptible and the towns further inland like brookings doesn t have a whole lot of protection by itself but i m curious how far inland a tsunami could travel up the rogue at gold beach i know the elevation startes to be a problem at some points but these things obviously have some gusto behind them pushing i m in medford and don t think it could reach the rogue river near here this far inland but the mountains might just end up helping the tsunami end up more inland due to the rivers i am glad my friend who has a house in brookings in atop a hill tho seems less likely to be damaged there,1
at 3 minute mark what is the guy rambling on about please isnt same emergency message to be sent as tsunami is close and wave height,1
actually this city was defenseless without any ocean walls least to say waterbreakers,0
they did have them but they weren t high enough especially when the water receded 3m they had no chance whatsoever,0

if he would just look at things slowly with the camera even thru heart breaking devastating event by mother nature the love the japanese have for there mother land is so overwhelming your awesome people,0
there s one thing you may not have thought of there were countless aftershocks for hours after the earthquake and a lot of people were really trying to remain as steady as they could,1
thank you for taking this video we all understand the truth about tsunamis now that was hard to watch so many affected or hurt or worse hope you and yours were all safe thank you again best wishes,1

if you post a picture be good handle a camera it s not good to see,0
and the flood mud gets everywhere,1
and that mud is filled with sewage human waste toxic chemicals moldy rotting wood rusting metal and the remains of dead animals humans etc in fact in some disasters disease kills more people that the original event a good example would be the horrific death toll in the wake of a major tropical cyclone that struck and flooded most of bangladesh around 50 years ago literally hundreds of thousands of people many died in the flooding most of bangladesh is low ground but a large percentage of the victims actually succumbed to disease during the months after the tropical cyclone,1

jesus christ stand still for like 5 seconds dude,0
stop f cking whining this is not a damn movie,0
the worst camera activity ever,0
,0
cant watch no more the camara was making me feel sick,0
so many people did nothing to get to higher ground i don t understand that at all,0
you have raised a fair question and it doesn t just apply to tsunamis but all types of natural disasters and it certainly applies to issues of personal safety too ultimately it s an issue of psychology sociology culture for starters people ignore warnings don t prepare for disasters and don t use safety equipment motorcycle helmets seatbelts wearing safety glasses etc because a perceiving risks understanding concepts like randomness odds of death is difficult and b preparing for bad events requires them to accept their own vulnerability mortality many people especially teenagers young adults have great difficulty accepting how dangerous random the world can be and find it difficult to accept that they cannot take complete control of their environment on top of that some cultures seem to encourage risk taking more tolerate a higher rate of injuries mortality among its youth the u s a is a good example when compared to other 1st world nations it has the highest rate of accidental injury death among youth young adults furthermore there has been a gender factor young males also feel peer pressure think that they re supposed to be able to deal with dangers protect others and prove that they re strong furthermore higher levels of testosterone in males definitely causes males to a experience less fear but more anger aggression when threatened in any situation except in really scary situations b be less risk adverse and c feel more confident in their physical intellectual abilities having said that over the last 50 years there has been an increase in injuries mortality among female teenagers young adults especially in western societies which suggests that risky behaviour is not just biochemical but also heavily influenced by societal factors perhaps role models more exposure to risk danger in careers that used to be male dominated etc i hope this helps,1
just dumbfounded at the lack of getting to higher ground that baffles me the ignoring of the warning sirens and just flat out doing nothing to retreat to higher ground no wonder so many lost their lives such a tragedy,1
now nearly 12 years since this terrible day has the authorities learnt from this our planet is showing us more devastation each time it hits us weather earthquakes tides are stronger and are we learning,1
i imagine there was someone who had asked where do we start and the response right here,0

what a tragedy this show brings me back humility love light to all,0

mother nature harsh,0
the damage to other places is huge but i went back and forth once and then stopped what to do about this place i m looking at it so the place i m avoiding now seems to be dangerous it s the first video i ve seen i ve never seen a long tsunami before so it s hard,1
minute 5 25 the tsunami is over in the police station se can see policemen inside why don t they go down to help the people what kind of policemen are they,1
hallo wenn du auf eine stelle im video hinweisen m chtest schreib 05 25 es wird verlinkt sodass man direkt dahin gehen kann,0

what was equally sad was seeing people sweeping up the day after i suppose that s their coping mechanism keeping themselves busy i m not japanese nor was i there but i ll never forget this day,0
i think you re right it reminds me of my in laws accounts of ww2 england during the london blitz same type of response same tough exterior,0
how overwhelming this must have felt,0
subthread camera shaking aftershocks fight or flight not knowing if family friends acquaintances alive or dead trying to see everything,1
omg,0
we had a tsunami alarm in the 1990 s on kauai hawaii i remember driving home up to kokee there were several dozen cars trucks trailers with horses mules people on horseback etc the wave did not hit but we always head for the hills,1
yes alarm either by animals or man made alarm is useful for early warning indeed but we never know how high the waves are some video i watch abt 3 11 warned for 3 meters high tsunami but the reality is different over 10 meter wave destroyed whole city,1
ktaeyoung the waves were higher at some coasts than expected because beside the earthquake there were also under water landslides involved the highest point was 40 meter 130 feet,1
it may have had a lot to do with what he was seeing thru the lens initially he was only seeing water come in but after the second retreat of water there would ve been unbelievable destruction numerous bodies in the water etc that s a lot to take in while happening in that moment,0
11 march 2021,0
so many people were at work around the docks and water ways also some had no high ground to run to it s so sad prayers to all the families who lost loved ones hopefully this will never happen again,0

i don t understand people that don t take any kind of warning seriously even now with covid 19 people who don t believe it or think it s a conspiracy theory idiots i m certainly not calling those who lost their lives in this tragic event idiots but if people just listened and evacuated right away i m sure there would ve been fewer deaths either way this was a horrible event and i remember being at school when it happened my best friend had family in japan and they were hit luckily they were all ok shit is scary i hope all those who were affected by this have recovered and those who lost their lives rest in peace,1
look up normalcy bias,0
razvansocol1966 correct also people ignore warnings don t prepare for disasters because doing so would require them to accept their own vulnerability mortality many people especially teenagers young adults have great difficulty accepting how dangerous random the world can be and that they cannot completely control their environment,1
if that was my dog i would be listening to him i can t begin to imagine the stress anxiety and sorrow you all go through far too often it s difficult to watch but i admire your courage and wish you the best possible outcome in the future peace,0
dogs just know they can sense things like earthquakes and shit i know if i were there and that was my dog i would ve dipped right the hell away,1
oh the dogs were all barking and the seagulls were wailing like the 2nd coming just listen in every video plus the retreat of the water is a sign that you better get far far away and very high up just in case they knew devestation was looming,0
where do you even begin after an event like this where and what do you start with other than the obvious looking after the well being of yourself and your fellow survivors,0
so very sad they are calling out for there loved ones,0
mi dispiace veramente tantissimo di quello che successo in tutto il giappone spero che mai pi dovrete rivivere una cos grande sciagura ho voluto vedere alcuni vs video ed ogni volta ho pianto per voi,0
i hope all the people from my country will watch this vi deo ii remember one the police patrol running on the street and anouce about there tusumi comeing 4 00 am in the morining the people attact the police car they said they distrubiing them the lie announacement,0
bad camera man at it s best mr if you stop doing all that talking and be still you can actually get awesome footage,0
then you go walk in the middle of a tsunami and film it dumbass,1
a little early to be drunk had a chance to get some useful data an blew it,0
worlds worst camera work,0
cut the guy some slack he s recording a natural disaster that was completely unforeseen let s see you go back to 2011 and record it better,1
i always thought that it was just one wave but after watching this both part 1 and 2 is now know after having seen this that there were about 10 or more each one comes in then drains out then comes in again one after the next every 10 15min,1
earthquake engineering huh,1
how come there is no visible damage of the 9 0 earthquake prior to the tsunami coming in there were 3 major earthquakes that day he first was a 7 3 the second a 9 and the third a 7 6 where is the damage from the 9 0 earthquake,1
rosemary malloy the japanese probably make very earthquake resistant buildings,1
they have building protocols regarding earthquakes very strict ones at it hence why most survived the earthquakes however wood vs tsunamis is a doomed collision,1

cameraman is 00000 and zero he have no idea of noting move more than sunami,0
black people moving in to a city does a lot more damage and destruction than a tsunami apparently,1

it could all end tomorrow folks we just never know hope your 10 hour a day jobs plus the hours spent in commuting time plus living debt are all worth it,0
isn t it worth it to you,0
most countries in the world don t have ten hour jobs you know that right the us is just the black sheep regarding this because you know people need to rise up and fight for their rights but americans lack the will and spine for something like that,0
it feels kind of surreal at the end here was a place that was a center of business and activity then at the end all you can hear is the odd footstep the call of the sea birds and the noise of the wind and the water imagine having that happen to your home town overnight,0
the japanese are resilient people my question is where do they put all the rubbish,0
dixie hull maybe burn it i m not exactly sure,0

ohhh whaa then stop watching it if you re snowflake body can t handle it and shut up,0
it was said before and i ll say it again listen to the dog,0
also watch and listen to the birds the birds start to fly around and caw crow and then a few seconds later the dog starts to bark then barks again and then again then the tsunami wave arrives,1
what seems to be the problem is people are not understanding the danger the warnings can clearly be heard and enough time is given but people look and think meh not too bad then bang too late,1
tucker that s because most of the tsunamis that have hit japan were very minor so these people thought it was another one of those minor tsunamis,1
read josephus he relates pliny the youngers assessment on people not fleeing or doing so too late,0
part of the problem is that the tsunami was initially predicted at two metres if i remember correctly so people expected two metres what actually came was something vastly bigger it s probably a good idea to ignore the predicted height of any tsunami and head for 30 40 metres above sea level anyway,1
thankyou for uploading this tsunamis have been happening forever but this is the first time the world has witnessed the true majesty and horror of nature the world knows that the brave people of japan will come back from this stronger than before,1
no such thing as mother nature,0
cs77smith67 are you ok because she did not say mother nature but even if she had mother nature is just an expression feel free now to go google that big big word expression and educate yourself,0
joonsmelodie9927 she still implying mother nature so what the difference but keep talking junk like u know it all then i ll educated your rudy poo candy in a boxing match and u know deep down u would get beat up by me,0
joonsmelodie9927 nature is the same as mother nature just to educate you i can also educate you in a boxing fight match as well but we both know who get beaten in that match,0
cs77smith67 let s fact check that with good ol merriam webster shall we nature noun the external world in its entirety mother nature noun nature personified as a woman considered to be the source and guiding force of creation therefore ur wrong they are different obviously mother nature is not real but the word nature is a very real thing and a word used regularly in science lol unless you believe everything around us externally is not real,0

joonsmelodie9927 from what i see here you just educated yourself there so you should give yourself a round of applause coz i m going by the context of what the girl said in the post ohhhh wait so you re admitted that i can beat you up in a street fight or a boxing match,0

joonsmelodie9927 you re wrong again on both the only reason i want to fight you boxing match is because you came at me the wrong way talking junk like you so brave and confident so i figure if you so brave online then you should be brave enough to fight me in person yeah i have beat up some guys but if that s your profile picture then i must say u look like one of them tough white girls that can fight so who knows even though you said i will beat u up maybe you will at least put up a decent challenge against me more then the guys i beaten who knows in fact to be honest with you i did get my kick by a 14 year old asian boy in boxing match not ones not twice but 4 times in a roll he beat me up pretty badly which is my most embarrassing moment of my life because i ve never won against him so u just never know right,0
joonsmelodie9927 i only want to fight you because you came at me with a bad attitude like you so brave and i figure if u so brave online you should be brave enough to fight me 1 on 1 boxing match right who knows maybe you ll be good enough to give me a decent challenge even though i won against a lot of gods put on the other hand i did get beaten up by a 15 year old asian boy so i guess u just never know right don t be scared,0
the scary things about tsunami s is that they can be no more than a foot tall far out at sea only become dangerous as the sea floor begins to rise when it approaches a land mass,1
yup true i think that s because far out in the sea when the wave is formed and starts to travel it has the volume of the entire water column inside of it right from the sea bed,1
so terrible,0
the little dog is sweet and very concerned,0
that entire 2 hours worth of footage and that s what you gathered,0
i really can t understand how can anybody laugh seeing such sad situation like that,0
someone probably told them a joke,0
,0
sometimes you have to vent everything in a laugh to keep from going insane with terror,0
hurricane irma on fluoride stolen from the houses of prophets raised by the scientists of the world and flew by plane to the united states there is more official secret information world,0
what,0
and why are there no 2nd n 3rd wave even acheh tsunami got more waves and why does the water return back to the sea with that speed,1
anna lemonade watch part 1 there are two sections to the waves they gradually rise then recede this seems to be the receding 2nd wave,1
where else would it go,0

and the men in the first video does anyone know if they survived,0
yes all 3 seen in the video made it into the building,0
cornwall and you know this how,0
the two on the bridge made it their story is told in another vid here the one in the blue shirt was saved by the other he was pulled to safety from his car as it passed over the bridge on the way out to sea not sure about the notebook guy but something tells me he did,0
im ersten video bei 32 23 f ngt die kamera beide mit zoom ein man sagt der alte herr h tte es auch geschafft viel gl ck und schutzengel gehabt meine herren,0
i m assuming the older man with the notepad under his arm didn t make it haven t seen him not once in part 2 don t know how he made it through part 1 i was so worried about him,0
i asked the same question had 2 men survivors,0
jessica i saw them too but didn t see them but just that one time,0
sue howard it seemed to me the people in the building were directing him that was when the tide receded i pray he did make it to safety,0
at 52 07 in part 1 the old man with the notebook makes his last appearance going off screen walking before the water came rushing in again he was away from the dock and crossing the bridge towards the building this was being filmed in maybe he went inside and that s why he isn t in this one,0
alyssa hernandez is right i spotted him again in part 1 around the 52 mark hes just nonchalantly watching the waters recede not sure if he thought it was over or what the people filming seemed to be directing him at least i hope,0
sue howard he ran around the wall past the buildings then jumped into the water still holding his file then got out by the bridge and walked off,0
sue howard yes he did make it i saw in interview with him i have no idea how he managed to survive he saved the guy in the light blue jacket also he made it but again i did not see how he got out of there the camera man here is not too steady hard to see anything at all,0
jessicamendes4511 if your taking about the 2 men one in blue seen talking and walking on the bridge together yes they did make it they were in documentary a week later that was subtitled in english saying that the one got caught on the bridge then saw they guy in the blue floating on the top of a car the bridge guy told the blue shirt guy to jump for it when he got close enough to the bridge and pulled him over the railings and onto the bridge then they made their way to a building before the water came back but said that they saw so many ppl who were still alive being swept out to sea as they were much closer than those with cameras and could see people trapped in cars and in rubble,0
emmaathome2902 i think he actually didn t jump into water its optical illusion he was walking on something lower just beside the water and as camera shook it seemed as if head was poping out as if he was swimming with current that strong he wouldn t be able to pull himself up in my opinion,0
jessicamendes4511 the two men from the bridge appear at 17 20 on this video,0
every time it looks like the water s receding back into the ocean it starts coming back in again these poor people can t catch a break,0
always 3 waves in a tsunami,1
the same thing happened during the 2004 boxing day tsunami also the japanese people have been through many earthquakes and tsunamis through the last 10 000 years and no that time factor is not a mistake nhk world japan has many historical documentaries about japanese history i m a big fan of nhk,1
at the start of the video the camera is steady on one shot almost as if mounted on a tripod he could be thinking oh i ll get some footage of the tsunami by the end the camera never stays still for more than a moment constantly panning as if unable to take in the overwhelming destruction and incomprehensible spectacle of what just occurred,1
correct wow,0
remember there s a videographer behind that camera it s not moving by itself,0

de ante a uma tragedia de grande propor ao tem gente rindo isso e muito estranho esse video e pessimo muito mal feito,0
janice permita me 2 observacoes primeira sera que o pessoal nao estava rindo exatamente por estar extremamente nervoso muitas pessoas e eu ja vi isso quando estao com os nervos a flor da pele comecam a rir eh o tal do riso nervoso segunda a pessoa que estava operando a camera estava sem nenhum tripe ou coisa parecida para apoia la segurando a provavelmente nas maos e pior dava um zoom para capturar imagens a quilometros de distancia darei um exemplo com uma camera nas maos tente gravar a imagem de um aviao que voa la longe de onde voce esta nao ha como o aviao nao sair tremido no video mas concordo plenamente com voce o nosso amigo cineasta cometeu o pecado de nao parar em nenhuma imagem assim eh preciso gostar muito de tsunamis para ver o video inteiro alem claro do tremendo esforco do cerebro para acompanhar 1 hora de imagens tremidas mas mesmo assim valeu pelo registro nao eh mesmo se eu estivesse no lugar dele esqueceria camera tripe heroismo e sairia correndo ou nadando ou voando como um super homem enlouquecido tentando salvar a pele a qualquer custo perdoe me a ausencia de crases acentos agudos circunflexos cs cidilhas e mais fruto das sempre indesej veis limita es da internet,1
chico de moraes falou tudo parab ns,0
they are not laughing about it now,0
please stop eating live frogs and octopus now,0
youre right time to repent and think of the almighty,0
the shock must be overwhelming the human mind has difficulty processing such scope where do you start with that mess,0
and just to think this is just one small harbor think about the entire coast then add the initial earthquake damage of the entire region and of course don t forget to add the radiation from fukushima,1
jerry dodge i hear ya the destruction is so far reaching i have live over a half century and i know i have never seen such destruction of property ww 2 was the last time destruction on this scale happened,0
ww2 had nothing on this,0
well there was the indian ocean tsunami a few years earlier 2004 or 2005 which killed a quarter of a million ppl,1
0yeme0 that was a horrible tsunami i remember the photos of coastline with piles of dead bodies and them throwing dead babies into dumpsters i had forgotten how horrible that was god rest their souls,1
godbluffvdgg yeah i get the feeling it is almost the forgotten disaster overshadowed in peoples memory by the vast amount of video footage from the japanese tsunami and in the recent consciousness by the ongoing problems at fukushima but in terms of mortality the indian ocean event was 20 or 25 times worse and one of the biggest natural disasters in recorded history,1
people are told oh fukishima isn t nearly as bad as chernobyl but actually it is worse,0
jerry dodge according to what i ve read the chernobyl event was characterized worse in terms of the radioactive particles carried by the air currents affecting many parts of the world,0
jerrydodge citation needed i don t see how that can be when fukushima had containment chernobyl had no containment,0
amazing video glad you made it and sorry for all the loss of people and other living things,0
they said 35 000 souls but if i see these all of the video s and picters there must be over a 100 000 souls i am so sorry for all of them but also for the animals love from holland,0
imagine this happening without the preparation and warning 15000 is a big number but it could have been far worse,1
15 000 is a big number its like the whole people in this world died holy shit this is sad as fuck and i dont know this cant be described in words its just for crying out loud there have been people dying like every second in this video its not only a big number its un encredible number just because the people thought it wouldnt be that bad yeah im so fucking omg poor japan,0
ice cookie 15 000 is about the size of the crowd in a professional basketball or hockey arena,0
over 18 000 people lost their lives,0
26 000 died,0
yep could of been worse could of been 250 000 christmas day 2004 indonesia,0
58 54 the ominous red glow on the sea that the sun leaves tells a tale about a sea of death,1
bad quality video,0
from all this you ve just saw your comment is bad quality video wtf,0
learn english and think before you ink,0
h ok you can teach me some english then the quality of the video is 240p low quality the camera is shaking sometimes but the man who s filming the catastrophe is doing his best i guess also the video is unedited and my question remains you saw a video about tsunami 1 hour of disaster and you wrote a comment about its quality,1
you re right maybe the guy should go back in time and recapture this moment with a camera that captures 4k60fps just so that you don t have to watch a 240p video of a disaster that claimed the lives of thousands wouldn t that be soo nice of him,1
arisordeath1 death and destruction human tragedy at its highest level man the video quality sucks only on youtube,1
hatstack that probably was the best camera he had be patient people,0
why don t you go back to 2011 and record it with your 4k camera,0
,0
i keep imagine when there are many people inside a small room but the wave is getting higher and bigger wtf thts my worst nightmare after thinking it huhhhh,1
very true rotff especially when the lights go out that s why we have gun laws in the united states in an emergency everybody s packing it s the law and everybody has a gun 9mm 40cal even pocketbook 22 s caliber doesn t matter and when a tsunami s coming everybody goes cowboy,1
i don t know what part of the country you live in but it is illegal to openly carry weapons in florida,0
my human hands can only be raised into the clouds,0
i know lumber is a big commodity in japan were there salvage operations to retrieve lumber after some days how many lost lives here it seems there needs to be classes everywhere near oceans to show more of how tsunamis work and destroy the temptation to survey damage before the waves are done seemed like a big killer and especially needs to be taught as a future warning around the world,1
japan is far more prepared for tsunami s than most of the world but this scale is unprecedented moved the earth on it s axis coastline dropped over a meter the us would have suffered far worse imagine when this happens off the san francisco coast at the number of deaths,1
i think i would move to somewhere at least a hundred meters above sea level i have actually had nightmares from watching the tsunami videos this has to be the biggest disaster in mans recorded history,1
some good advice is to not watch them just before bedtime,0
this was the costliest ever the boxing day tsunami killed 250000 this one killed 25000,1
a hundred meters is overkill forty will do fine no recorded tsunami is known to have hit 40 meters the 1898 tohoku tsunami was reported as 60 metres but evidence shows it was actually about the same height as this one,1
,0
no the 2004 earthquake and tsunami had a rating of 9 3 and it took the lives of 227 348 people then there was the alaskan earthquake and tsunami of 1964 and many many more,1
jennregier if an asteroid hits the ocean it will make that wave look like a ripper so you might want a head to hire ground,1
there is an eerie appeal to watch the footage shot by all of the survivors the peaceful ocean showing her power to wipe out life and property i am sorry for you all in this video was the place where you were filming from a planned sanctuary or just the first solid looking high place did most of the boats in the first video who were heading out to sea survive what about the men on the sea wall during the first video who were looking at the tied up small and one larger boat,0
first wave second wave thirth wave a neverending nightmare,1
allah doesn t exist,0
there is only one god and he is known by many names,0
so when god changed his name as alluded to in the bible somewhere did he first get the new name and then repeal so to speak his old name or did he lose the old name then pick a new name meaning that for a time god had no name,0
somebody better call jake from statefarm,0
jake from statefarm crapped his khakis,0
i imagine that if you were watching your own apartment building getting half swept away if that three story building that survived the first wave barely was your home and you were afraid your loved one was in that building still you might risk it,1
or very tall heavy buildings that can t be swept along,0
it would be incredibly disheartening to watch your town being systematically trashed in front of your eyes and being able to do nothing about it,0
,0
i don t think so p,0
japan should have like a fleet of blimps with loudspeakers and what not like the ones the army uses for surveillance,0
if my phone didn t skip alot i would have liked this video that s so sad and scary,0
the water goes one direction then the other half way in,0

how many nights you stay at the building before you went home,0
went home most of the buildings were gone there s no home to go back to,0
hope we all learn something,0

i have a question for the filmtaker mr otani how many times did the flow of water in towards you and flood and when did it finally receed permanently,1
i believe there were 2 in and 2 out not real sure about this but i thought the 2nd wave was larger although the first one pretty much destroyed everything,1
there were more than 2 waves in this town,1
lemardyc 39 34,0
hey japan lives on what she gets from the sea and by imports but i do agree about limiting the amount of hunting done too much and it will disappear then what will you do i personally love bonito flakes on my rice with cheese or cream hehe but deora your comment was inappropriate for this venue,0
you should work on your senseitivity,0
amen,0
moral of the story dont build houses on the dock of the bay,0
moral of the story don t build skyscrapers since it s like begging for them to be attacked right us,0
this unedited video is informative as opposed to the prevalent newscasts because as the intervals between the recession of the 2nd 3rd and 4th waves clearly shows it is seen that people were going to lower elevations despite the repeated threat of multiple waves the loss of the protective time buffer of the seawalls and floodwalls despite their failure and the loss of local emergency broadcast systems to warn of continuing dangers,1
i rode my bike through kamaishi in 2011 and 2012 it s freaky recognizing some of the bigger buildings and seeing how high the water went,0

terrible tsunami video,1
can hear the wind up flashlights generators 42 xx,0
anyone else think it s weird that the sky was overcast the entire time of the wave s and cleared up after it had subsided,1
nope not really entirely unrelated,0
thank you for sharing this video with all of us you did a great job and people will learn form your work i m so sorry for all of you such a tragedy my prays for all of you,0
well said,0
i thought the water only went through once now im seeing it go through several times thats realllly terrible i had no idead it continued so long rewashing everything,1
gary james the undersea shock results in ripple on the surface the waves are the ripples and the coast is hit as long as those ripples are still big enough to come thar farvand that strong,1
ever made a wave in a bathtub think of that on a massive scale,1
they learned what tsunamis do when they re much larger than expected they know what problems happened during the tsunamis structural failures and whatnot that they wouldn t have known by arriving after it was all done now they know new ways to protect human life during such a disaster,1
exactly what did scientists learned and what they gonna do about it anyway whatever happened happened nothing went wrong and nothing bad happened earth moved ocean rose and the consequences followed there s nothing much we will be ever able to do about it but i see the underlying point of self importance that humans seem to exercise all the time you re making in your comment but our own importance matters only within our own perspective,0
the scientists learned there are more afterwaves coming they learned to build higher walls in the coastline to break off the waves more effectively they learned so much and hopefully more people will survive next time this happens,1
thnx to the poster appreciate it i would never ve seen the details on tv or anywhere else in video,0
and not just scientists learned from this videos but i as well living in a tsunami zone i never thought about this possible income to be honest before this videos i probably would have thought lightly if those sirens ever went off how many of us now are going to react differently because of these videos that is what makes them heroes in a sense because they have and will change lives,1
if you lived in a area with high probability of being hit by tsunamis and you didn t give a shit about tsunami alarm sirens and warnings then you were but i stop here before insulting you probably this disaster would have brutally brought you back to reality,1
i live in an active earthquake and tsunami zone approx 500 quakes per year and literally one minute from the ocean the tsunami has always terrified me more than the quakes themselves,1
it doesn t take a video to learn about sirens if i ever heard them in our state i know something s up no matter where i live i don t need this video to tell me that so don t ever think likely about sirens or ignore them you may never make it,0
you fail to realize a hero is someone to saves someones life and i said in a way meaning partly because these videos can be used to save more lives in the future you are free to disagree but some people may never know in the future that these recordings helped save their lives because scientists got a good look at the nature of the waves and how they behaved it was easy to think of a tsunami as one wave before this disaster now many of us know how very different,1
you re totally right both scientists and other people too this helps you get perspective of how much time there can in between waves about how quickly tsunami can go how strong it is after seeing this you can visualize this scenario in your head and perhaps how you should react if you were caught up in this humans best learn from what they see so before you could film disasters people didn t really have clue about how bad that disaster could get even if they heard or read the accounts of somebody who witnessed it,1
and i assume in the same situation your presentation on the events would be a rock steady oscar winning performance sure the video is a bit jumpy and zooming like a yo yo but as the title says its unedited and raw footage i think its fair to say the person filming this couldnt believe what they were seeing and were trying to get as much as possible recorded,0
exactly people out here bitching about the camera work like shut up imagine if that happened to you people are annoying,0
thanks to shunsuke otani for recording this and making it available for us all to see and remember,0

don t forget the eastern side of the united states how many times have hurricanes have hit florida south carolina north carolina virginia and all the way to maine but when they are gone we bitch and moan that the state should rebuild the highways so the people who once had ocean front can go back home when to start with they should have never been able to build so close to the ocean to begin with humans will never learn we live to play the odds,0
10 17 is that a bunch of bodies floating or just err something that looks like body shaped objects,0
10 17 alles sieht so aus muss es aber nicht haushalte wurden von den wellen leergefegt und alles schwamm dann auf dem wasser,0
all that water going back to sea doesnt mean its over tsunamis do that it drains than comes back,1
you only need to watch this for two minutes and you ve got a headache the camera s all over the place and zooming in and out all the time the subject matter is painful but this footage is total garbage,0
it s a civilian recording an unexpected natural disaster not a hollywood film set wtf did you expect,1
i hope you have had time to grow up because this post of yours sound like a child s whining,0
aha i understand yes the earthquake of march was a big one,1
same here same here wept like a child,0
that would most likely be due to the fact that you probalby arn t too familiar with the lithosphere plate tectonics or the ionosphere ionized particles the layers of the ionosphere plasm and how it repels certain kinds of radio waves etc don t blame things just because you have yet to understand them my friend,1
don t blame god for this disaster he s not the one who built home businesses and schools in tsunami prone areas japan is the most seismically active country in the world they have accurate historical records of tsunamis going back centuries sooner or later this was bound to happen a lesson we should learn before the pacific northwest coast suffers a similar fate,1
apparently what she s trying to say is if you build stuff near the beautiful ocean you deserve to lose all of your shit i can t feel sorry for you obviously a very compassionate woman,0
i know this comment was made 10 years ago but damn this is the coldest most callus comment i ve seen on the subject my the god you obviously believe in have mercy on your soul,0
dejabluebeartc jane s statement may be upsetting but nothing she stated was inaccurate often the first step towards learning from one s mistakes is to accept uncomfortable truths about the situation that goes for our daily lives and it also applies to society when a large disaster occurs so there was nothing callous about what jane wrote because what she stated was a lesson to be learned one that would hopefully save lives in the future if jane had belittled or otherwise insulted the victims or if she had found humour in the suffering of the victims then that would have been callous but she did not do any of those things,1
with that ridiculous statement then every country building skyscrapers shouldn t whine when they get attacked because they put those attack prone buildings there to start with same thing with train stations underground or anything worth to attack seriously woman you are a monster,0
30 years later japan tsunami in 2011 was just child play said us commander in chief,1
george w bush said that,0
just months before 9 11 george w bush said that,0
that must have been trump sorry he s not much into telling the truth,0
who else wants to throw that god damn dog in the water and enjoy the video,0
i want to throw u,0
too bad you weren t there we could have thrown you in there and feed the crows with you,0
think what would u do in a situation like that shit happening 360 degrees u wanna film it all dummy,0
haarp or nature natureeeeee,0
when was haarp invented there had been numerous earthquakes on this planet even before human exists how can we explain the planet s earthquakes before haarp s invention are haarp believers saying that after haarp s invention all natural earthquakes had suddenly stopped and haarp is to be blamed where s the logic,1
sorry this happened to your beautiful city friend i hope your friends and family were ok,0
man can t create earthquakes earthquakes have always been around the happen with or without humans every year about 30 000 earthquakes happens in japan most are to small to be noticed but some are bigger new zealand chile japan mexico indonesia and alaska are the places where most earthquakes happen it has nothing to do with haarp,1
man made haarp so man made god anyway earth is not belong to human it belongs to their own,0
and don t assume it s over till you get the all clear how many times did it look like the water was going away for good,0
in a way all the people who recorded the tsunami are heros their videos give scientists a good view on what happened and what went wrong in the future what they learned from watching these videos will save other lives,1

pppp mm pp,0
i hope and pray the japanese coast facing inwards to russia dprk south korea are safe and the tsunamis predicted 1 1 24 fails to materialise but being closed water my guess is the japan sea is about to be another destructive mother nature event it certainly looks grim stay safe japan x,1
i am from america and i watch this unfold live from cnn news but these video show how devastating it was in japan that day and i ve watched them all and i still cry and feel so much sympathy for those that experience it and pray for the lost lives this is so devastating and unreal that mother nature can do this much to so god bless all who were and still affected by 2011 tsunami in japan,1
,0
nothing went wrong the water simply overran the coast only a lucky few places survived this one move higher because the water always wins,0
ruthless but however reality we shall survive in this archipelago,0
btw sin is not the only bad thing in the world what about animals lives why the animals need to torcher itch other to eat sorvive its a world where the strongest sorvives not the righteous dont forget we are only humans for 50 000 years where wos god when we were animals,0
he just lets the world go on as it dose ye after he made all the suffering sin in it if we the ppl smart enuf to not make suffering knowingly wudent you think a smart being like god would know its wrong so for you sin is free will you realize thet in the futer ppl wont sin couse ppl evolving geting smarter so in the futer when we wont sin we wont have free will,0
if we could build living things we would never build sin or bad things knowingly in them cause we know the consequences but ur god will are we smarter more moral then ur god the sad thing is that you can only explain gods ways by describing the living things as only a game we make the games bad cause this is a way for our brain to release adrenaline witch makes us feel good,0
what the hell are you babbling about,0
the tsunami was caused by crab people crab people,1
and if a programer had a choice to program a robot without sin but he programd it with sin would you think hes a good programer,0
so god made us with sin but he dont send ppl to hell what if you would program a robot with sin but with free will can you acuse him of sin if he sins or it will be the programer folt,0
what can i say people love conspiracy theories,0
i still can t believe this was more than a year ago,0
god be with us always god lives in our heart god teaches us to feel good when we had done something good,0
so if i do someting bad to you god will balance but if i do someting bad to god then he will kill my little baby al my famely,0
its not normal but wait isent your god is more important then your morallity if you decideing what is moralliy good for you anywey why you need him for,0
wrong i mean if you do something bad to me our judge god will do something to balance if i revenge to you as you are a fully grown person i may be fine too but not to your kid that s not normal at this moment of the world as a matter of fact we all know how to be a true human being if we do something good such as helping a old man crossing the road or giving candy to a kid our minds be happy on the contrary if i do something terribly wrong maybe you will agree that punishmen,0
so what u saying is if i did sometting bad to you it will be morally good for you to kill my litle baby we killing animals to survive it had notting to do with revenge btw we know how the tsunami happens so saying god doing it its like say god made a car crush,1
i believe you had eaten meat chicken beef or vegetables fruit or anything why people have to murder the cow the chicken or even the lettuce because this is the nature they all have their roles in this world the kids have their roles too when their parents their country had lost their mind and fail to play their roles their human being form would be deleted,0
we all have sins what about the 1 2 year old kids who died what were they sins iven if they did a 2 year old dont understan good from bad yet if a man wud do the same things thet ur god is doing you will call him a murdera so u have good god kip worshiping him,0
god has given us a humanbeing form to live however some people want to be animals and then these forms be treated as animal please cherish your opportunity,0
yes we all had sins did you read bible do you know who is jobs have you ever think about how to live a good life everyone have their roles to play if you fail hell be your destination,0
its god so he dont mind to kill innocent ppl,0
or was it just the movement of tectonic plates,0
3 11 14 46,0
it has to be god who created nature wickedness will bring judgement,0
swlovesvegans i may add that since i infact was there and saw the destruction i really tend to get annoyed by all these people claiming that it was caused by haarp we even had those guys in japan and yes the most certainly look and talk just like you d imagine,0
swlovesvegans thank you my kind sir,0
mansanraps lmao batmobile,0
marlorodo a small fifth wave a tsunami is an event caused by displacement of water by various methods just as a pond continues to have ripples from a thrown rock which spread around the surface after the large initial ripples wash onto shore oceanic tsunamis continue to reflect and refract for many hours after what caused them has subsided great and small currents are also set into motion and can persist for more than a day,1
yeah but the thing is those ripples don t become bigger ways when they get to shallow land,0
ilovemoneyalot101 there was a 104hr warning from an anonymous member yeah right word of that came out 104 hours after the quake and tsunami the net is loaded with credulous gullible and ignorant folk try replacing unfounded belief with verified knowledge critical thinking and due diligence research will take one much closer to the truth belief does not equal knowledge,1
what happened at 22 00 panic started again,0
ja schrecklich brigens wenn du eine stelle im video angeben willst schreib einfach 22 00 dann ist diese stelle verlinkt,0
a small fifth and a fire,0
a fourth wave,1
soyounoat stop harping about it,0
mansanraps well it was not a prediction it was a warning that he had harrp files the he hacked to get that said that there was going to be a tsunami pm if you want to see the pictures of the cali tsunami that where stolen from harrp i have two that he leaked but now he has vanished anonymous members who knew him are trying to find him but we fear that he was wiped out the internet because he leaked the 104hr count down for the tsunami,1
ilovemoneyalot101 well that warning proved to be pretty worthless for the people of tohoku since they never got it funny how all predictions only ar mentioned after the fact a megathrust quake will hit the alaska subduction zone and a slip thrust at about m7 m8 will strick california like it always has look i m not trying to bash people i just look at the facts and see the truth for what it is that is the truth,1
mansanraps why are you bashing on him there was a 104hr warning from an anonymous member alias mitchel combes that it was going to happen and the next one is aimed at california,1
bagatan63 yeah surely just like the last big one back in 869 not to mention the 1896 quake or the massive one in 1933 kobe 1995 haarp 2004 tsunami haaaaarp or was it god a lot of people think so hmm maybe haarp and god did it omg omg haarp is god o you sir are a genious quick to the batmobile,1
yes it is wierd that it came back 3 or more times thank you for uploading good luck to families and friends who have lost love ones in the tsunami may your country recover soon and i hope all of our funding that we made posseble for you is beeing well spend not like in turkey,1

all that destruction in every direction and still islands of life,0
the trauma that must exist to witness this horror,0

knowing there s probably hundreds of people in that wave being swept away,1
what idiots stay down at the water wonder what happened to the guy on the wall,0
the red and the green t shirt 2 petson probably die,0
the dog barking senses the danger is coming,1
they know they live in an area where this happens yet do little to nothing in way of sea defence bet you wished you built a wall 90 foot high now don t ya and i am guessing that even after this event what have they done well i ll tell you nothing apart from rebuild back on the same spot and collect as much polystyrene as possible i have no sympathy for people like this aye up mate you can t park there,0

id like to hear more from survivors and more of the experiences i ve watched some but its incredible to think most those building got reduced into splinters and back to the foundations i really don t think the people still don t see how much danger they were in even when the port and the docks disappeared slowly they were casually watching its only until most of the structures were gone that they knew they were in trouble,1
the amount of danger these people were in and they had very little to judge accept wait in high places and even the dog was sulking for a good number of minutes before hand its very slow but subtle how much water goes missing and how fast it crept up,1
japan had very soft houses like in usa,0
girl that s like in 2011 japan it s not modern yet,0
how can the people tell if it is a tsunami warning or a godzilla attack,1

strange how the radio is calmly issuing warnings while the actual apocalypse is occurring outside,1
japanese women talk a lot,0
someone shut up the stupid dog,0
21 35 its heartbreaking to hear these people laugh,0
i have questions i live thousands of miles from any ocean sea or gulf in corn country i know nothing about these if you re in a boat or ship can you feel an earthquake even an under the ocean type why do i see boats rushing towards the waves as sirens are going off opposed to quickly docking and running to higher ground can a large ship survive huge waves such as the 3 11 ones,1
really bad camera man hopeless,0
shut the dog up,0

some person reached out and slap the person who is laughing and thinks this is funny it is so not funny and he is an idiot hole,0

the whole beginning i think i m looking out at the horizon then i saw the white foam and realized that was the wave,1
seeing the water retract as a second wave builds up power is terrifying,1
japan the next day that was one of the worst experience of my life ok lets go back to work,0
the balls on that 1 man walking through the rubble as the waters receded i can only think he was in shock or has balls like watermelons,0
,0
the constant movement of the camera was making my head dizzy and to start hurting i couldn t finish the video but what i did see was devastating my heart hurt for all the lives lost both human and animal too many times pets livestock and wildlife perish i believe that if you have a pet or livestock it is the utmost responsibility of the owner to save them never leave your pets behind just to save your own lives treat pets as children as no one would leave their children behind they are living beings and should be treated with care and concern for their safety as they are incapable of saving themselves also take heed to every single warning as you never know when it will be so dangerous it will take your life complacency can cause loss of life please do not take those warnings lightly,1
omg y mas omg que tragedia de principio a fin para esa ciudad costera mis mas sinceras condolencias a los familiares de los fallecidos tras este tsunami que dios sea tu consuelo y que a los fallecidos dios los tenga en su gloria eternal desde chile antonella di vanni di biaggio edad 27,1

what an amazing culture look at how many buildings survived the 9 0 quake then listen to how calm the people are as they wait for the tsunami and then after the event is over look at how much still stood i remember my first quake in san francisco i didn t know what was going on at first but 50 women in my office from the philippines started screaming in tagalog to mother mary the shaking only lasted long enough for me to figure out i was in an earthquake and it was only a 5 0,1
yes the pedo traitors are preparing to detonate more oceanic torpedoes to wash out new york hoover dam and other coastal cities as depicted on 20 50 and 100 bills pure evil by judas followers wake up y all,0

the people on those boats most likely died,0

this video admits in full view that the earthquake was engineered wow how ballsy is that,1
how so exactly and where when is that claim admitted,0
poempadgett4664not admitted so much as the channel posting this video footage clearly shows as earthquake engineering research institute do you not see it,1
classicaldeb again how is it shown that the earthquake was engineered exactly i do understand about the existence of darpa haarpa etc however earthquakes and resulting tsunamis have always existed long before those governmental international agencies ever did and if you re right what would have been the rationale for doing it i m really curious,1
poempadgett4664well i ve been learning or finding out truths that have not been known to me in my life one being that the weather is manipulated by the powers that be for many decades recent examples are maui and la fires north carolina floods all engineered why you ask people in high places don t want the rest of us to continue to exist,1
you can see the water drop about 10 ft within 5 minutes before the waves hit in the beginning of the video if you watch it again,1

those days it looks like they don t estimate what catastrophe is waiting that will cost their lives,0

no one was prepared for the events that day the entire japanese tsunami defence network was designed and built to protect against a tsunami reaching 10 metres 30 feet at its peak run up the tsunami reached 40 metres 133 feet and it inundated inland to a distof 9 6 kilometres 6 miles tsunami safety centres safety structures and safety zones were located and constructed based on the 10 metre 30 feet tsunami prediction consequently survivors crammed into those supposed safety places died in their thousands when they were inundated wiping out entire generations of families that had together sought shelter japan had a brutal realisation that their world famous sea defence network the longest most sophisticated system ever created was utterly overwhelmed by the actual reality of nature quite what their original prediction of 10 metres 30 feet was based on has never been explained nor has the reason for constructing a nuclear power station directly on the coast at the exact area known for earthquakes and tsunamis whomever authorised that should face criminal charges their dereliction of duty and reckless negligence is the cause of the fukushima nuclear disaster and for turning the region into a grotesquely contaminated uninhabitable wasteland,1

these souls are alive because they had a good building to survive in i can t imagine what it must have been like to experience this it s something to remember forever the two guys on the bridge along with another walking on top of a seawall blows my mind how that can be and then along comes a guy carrying a satchel under his arm out of the water who were these people and has their story ever been told,0
pan zoom zoom pan,0
hold the camera still,0
44 58 why is this guy down there,0
yeah and after all these years of tsunami you have all those big pretty mountains in the background lots of forest flatten out the mountains make a lot of property up on top i just push all the dirt to the side and make a nice flat land build all your homes on top of that and oh my goodness then you re home sweet and be taken but that s just my thought have a bunch of mountains that don t do anything but stay out of the tsunami,1

the breakwaters piling jetty s etc all have a daily occupation it s to help provide easier waters for vessels to do their returns business and mooring facilities without risking their boat and personnel,0
32 27 the tsunami covered the city where did the two men come from how could they be alive,1
it looks like the water rose quickly but then abated quickly too,0
those two men down by the waterside must have had boiling frog syndrome they just stand there as the water rises and rises no way they could have survived,0

humans are iften bad at judging the risks from a fire wave etc heading towards them failing to realize how quickly it will be upon them in another vudeo some old folks were struggling to get their granny carts up some stairs that led to higher ground a guy tried to help them but rather than make them abandon their carts he tried to help them varry them up the stairs and oaid with his life he made the mistake of getting behind her and if turning his back towards the oncoming water she was almost swept away too when the water knocked them iff if the stairs but she managed to grab onto some shubery and climb back up the hillside to the stairs i couldn t live knowing i needlessly caused aomeone to die that way we all need to make an escape olan for natural disasters so during the heat if the disaster we don t oanic and do something that will get us killed,1
so sad i wonder how many people have died only in this city,0

was ist das wei e was gleich am anfang sehr sehr schnell durch das bild fliegt,0
i don t know what would scare me the most the water coming in or when it s going out,0
that one uncle who goes for a walk round the harbour during a tsunami just minding his business,1
those idiots down standing on the wall,0
i have watched many hours of these videos and without fail the people making them refuse to actually show any human loss for many minutes at the start of this video the camera watched several idiots at the seawall but when the water rises did they think it wouldn t the camera looks away every videos is like this we get hours of cars and houses being swept away but no one actually is overtaken by the ocean or so it appears,0
what about those people walking,0
the first 20 mins of this video was so boring,0
don t those people know the dangers of tsunami s,1
at 1 minute and 5 seconds what flies behind the hill and into the sea and a few seconds later takes off to the right of the screen due to going behind the mountain a comparison with the size of the ship it was pretty big not a bird,0
maybe a bug in front of the camera i did see it very fast,0
did you notice the birds appear out of nowhere and then disappear strange,0

i didn t know there d been a second wave,1
sounds like the restaurant at the end of the universe,0
why are the boats heading toward the wave,1
to get out of the harbor trying to save themselves the tsunami out on the open water is just a big swell,1
at around 13 00 if you take your finger and scrub forward to 17 00 you get a sense of how quickly the water rises it s frightening,0
amazing how powerful water can be my goodness using cars and houses has battering rams,0
those people on the docks,0

this tsunami happened in japan in 2011 i heard a lot about it on tv and in newspapers but today watching real footage like this i just realized how terrible and scary the tsunami was,1
the dog knows something catastrophic is coming but nobody is listening,0
despite being hit by numerous tsunamis japan has managed to remain a technologically advanced country imagine how much further it could have progressed if it had never faced such devastating disasters,1
i jus not understand why did thos not listen to the warnings we were taught at very young age by our elders to respect the elements of this planet we call earth mother earth is so awesome to let rain fall so our plants grow to feed us for tree s to grow to provide shelter n fire for warmth the wind to cool beware tht thos elements water fire wind land thy can take everything away i watch the news look at the weather i not jus worry bout my country but for all land of all people please always listen for tht warning i watched ths day on news cried w all families tht day week months still pray for all to b safe everywhere on this planet we call earth,1
those two people on the wall are stupid,0
i cannot imagine seeing that with my own eyes,0
this was the saddest thing to watch those poor people watching the destruction of their homes and livelihood wash away devastating,0
i m amazed at how calm they are i don t think i could be so devastating,0
so scared,0
the scope of destruction is always that of the second wave and it was the coup de grace coasts of japan see these videos after so many years always makes a lot impression i think and hope that all souls now rest in peace,1
watching the boats trying to get into open water befroe the tsunami hits is nerve wracking,1

even the dog started barking to warn the people that something was happening n when u see that we r hopeless to do anything with mother nature don t u all think that its time to try to get along with others in this world instead of fighting wars n killing each other it just seems so stupid when u look at disasters that nature can inflict on us all we should all just try to get on with each other s no matter what because aren t we supposed to b the most intelligent things that ever walked on this planet then its about time we acted like it then surely,1
watch the pier pilings from the beginning you see the water level dropping ahead of the tsunami then you can see it rapidly rise until the pier is underwater and that s like 5 minutes before the big wave hit you can really notice it if you speed up the video you can imagine hundreds of years ago play something like this happened the people would think it was the end of the world in all reality it was the end of the world for a lot of people just completely and utterly mortifying,1

great job on the video it really captures the raw emotion of that day i must say though while it s important to remember such tragic events i sometimes wonder if showing unedited footage like this can be more harmful than helpful it might reignite trauma for some survivors rather than educate those who weren t there what do you all think,0
the ones who dont want to want see these videos can always skip them,0
i really appreciate the effort put into this video it s important to remember such significant events however i can t help but feel that showing unedited footage might be too intense for some viewers sometimes a bit of context or sensitivity in presentation can go a long way don t you think,0

so sorry for your loss,0
i have often wondered how the gentleman in the blue overalls at the 52 minute mark got on did that second large wave let him get to safety great video,1

what about this man at 52 30 did he survive man was like spidman climbing on a cable to get to the bridge but then the second wave hits,1
hold the damn camera still,0
that s incredible if you compare the horizon at the start of the video to 18 minutes in you can see the full wave coming,1
so frickin scary it seems all calm and then off in the distance you see a monster approaching,0
good point of reference thank you,0
better run for the hills people,0
people took it so lightly despite of warnings,1

the dogs know what s coming sad humans can t realize what s going on,0
this is one of the best videos cause it shows kind of the timing of the whole event it starts out with the earthquake then you see the water recede then you see the tsunami reach the breakwater and pours into the opening then the tsunami overtops the breakwater and the water starts rising rapidly flooding the port before overtopping the seawall and wrecking the whole city you even see it receding again and another wave coming in it just shows how fast the event progressed and how quick the tsunami reached the city after the earthquake if i m not mistaking kamaishi was the first town to be hit by the tsunami which is why it has high casualties despite all the evacuation sitesz,1

i live on the northern part of the pacific ring of fire and this scares me to death so devastating,1
it seems like the dog is warning of the imminent danger,1
,0
so did those guys standing around the docks in the beginning not make it,0
did anyone spot the strange bolt of light traveling across the dock and off into the water really fast it could be an artifact from the video but it looked to me like it was real and possibly even noticed by the camera man it happens in just the very first ten or fifteen seconds of the video and travels from the right side to the left side along the dock and off the end into the water right about the nine second mark and it happens quick they describe phenomena like this being commonplace during events like this so strange,0
,0
uh oh the town is being washed away is the party over,0
was that guy near the end really bobbing in the water and came out like a champ unbelievable hard to kill wow,0
so sorry japan,0
pas unedited du tout,0
joke s are high in this video laughing and giggles among many there although a warning has been issued many still ignore them and just laugh then all hell breaks loose and peoples laughter becomes screams we humans never learn,1

why is the water going backwards,0
as i watch this video and others of this tragic disaster i begin reflecting on myself and my fellow americans i see the japanese people helping each other and being kind to each other people were telling rescue helicopters to rescue others in need before themselves there was no looting rioting raping assaulting blaming etc do you believe that modern day americans would behave this way in the same situation if you do you see a different america than i do,1
the old man they are mocking has more balls than all of them put together 52 12,0
why are these people laughing hahaha,0
i must say that the people who filmed this travesty were 1 laughing and 2 perhaps in shock there is nothing funny about this tsunami period,1
yes,0
it would help if i could understand japanese i assume that you can t either then we d know the context of the laughter anxiety sarcasm i have a tendency to giggle when i m nervous,0
could be words you don t speak japanese,0
unfortunately i couldn t watch this video with the sound on because of the unmercifully annoying barking going on in the background,0
the dog already knows things arent right,0
the victims have been let down by the government fukushima is still an utter disgrace as are the management team who provided dishonest reports on a clapped out nuclear structure with major unreported faults,1
now the docks under water,0
you can see the water residing by watching the pillars of the dock,0
i wonder if the people on their boats survived to tell their story,0
48 44 seconds in man filmed walking as second wave is inbound but dissapeared before wave arrived or before the water level was anywhere near him wtf please someone tell me where he could have gone i dont see a safe place for him to hide from the second tsunami wave where is he,1

how so many people didn t leave as soon as possible,0

why does the japanese only believe in mostly white vehicles,0
its hard to believe its been close to 13 years since this happened 3 01 24 is when im watching this i live well inland no where near an ocean it looks like the first wave is barely moving ik thats how the tsunami behaves but it almost looks stalled,1
you ll notice the waters turn red it is because being in that torrent is like being in a blender absolutely horrifying,0
the dog was trying to tell them danger was coming,1
how did those guys get down there so fast the tsunami is still receding its still dangerous to be by the water,1

at 1 00 35 i freaked out because i thought that was a body floating just under the car it s possible it was but i hope not with the destruction and death toll i know people were pulled out to sea because of the number of missing people but actually seeing it and seeing people in their last minutes alive is horrific in other videos seeing the people running from the tsunami breaks my heart even though i didn t know them just knowing they didn t make it is devastating my prayers go out to all who didn t make it and their families as well as all of the survivors who witnesses this astronomical tragedy i pray that they are happy today and they ve been able to recover and have peaceful and successful lives now,1

i couldn t believe seeing ppl walking to the docks the dudes in the red and green sweater wth were they thinking when there s a tsunami warning in place there s no way they made on time to safety since hell broke loose seconds after rip to everyone who lost their souls that day i couldn t the fear of not running fast enough while the water is behind me can t understand why will someone risk themselves unnecessarily is like they we re waiting for the waves to come,1

the 2 most horrific things i ve seen in my lifetime that caused an immense death tolls other than war are this tsunami and the 9 11 terrorist attacks i still watch them both in disbelief and i feel such shock and sadness for what those people had to endure the terror for them was unbelievable,1
watch the documentary on the boxing day tsunami it s insane,1

usually i wouldn t comment before finishing a video but i am just 5 minutes in and all i can think about is how come since i can clearly hear the efforts of the early warning system why am i seeing several ships apparently just continuing out and about on their way,1
they are driving the boat towards the wave to try and escape before it gets bigger and reaches land,1
overly nourished entity ok i guess that makes sense i m not very familiar with tsunami survival techniques i just saw what looked like a bunch of places to dock the boat i think i would rather take my chances on land,1
i ve been thinking about the boats heading towards sea in the beginning of this video lately hopefully they all made it but guessing unlikely,0
,0
i ve never witnessed such terror as this and all this destruction those poor victims of this loss of life and everything they had such terrible tragedy,0
it s incredible because you can actually see the horizon line rise about 17 minutes into the video is the highest point amazing,0

what goes up must come down that is a known saying what about what comes forth can go back sounds dumb of me to suggest but i don t care because maybe someone can get some idea from it i m not smart and my ideas may be lame but i will still try to help with anything i can do and even if it s dumb don t make sense ideas i will still try help,0
can the force of natural gravity of purplosion that s not spelled right and i can t think of the word that means push forth anyways maybe something that gravity and the power that s pushing forth can cancel out one by the other to at least lesson that power of tsunami,1
it s hard to watch these videos and know a lot of folks lost their lives and that s such a heartbreaking scenario of any tsunami to witness let alone go through my deepest condolences to all survivors tsunami s since they are such a disasterous force of nature to way of life there needs to be more ways to combat them to divert or harness their destructive power there has got to be a way to accomplish this tsunami s are just too devastating to not try find way to come up with something you have very advanced technology for electronics and the capability of engineering feats that surpasses most someone has to come up with something to help there has just got to be a way,1

the perseverance in the japanese and their ability to tolerate hardship without taking it out on others is awe inspiring my heart goes out to the people of japan as they continue to rebuild,0

did anyone else see the fisherman standing in his red gear on the cement sea wall when the water started rising as the docks below were starting to be covered i don t think he was able to get back to the boat still heartbreaking to watch,0
i wonder how many bots seen leaving the harbor actually survived their run,0
sea walls provide people with false security when breached they increase the velocity of the water increasing damage and then restricting water from receding and all of that debris flowing back out to sea that is the source of the great pacific garbage patch that us environmentalist have ben blaming us plastic manufacturers and boaters,0

animals are still your best warning system the dog knew what was coming also see how all the birds are flying around animals have a mandate to survive and benefit by not letting emotions get in the way,1
i think this is one of those situations where if i had a boat in the harbor and was on it when the earthquake hit i d be going full out to get out of there that one boat was doing so but the others looked like they were leisurely heading out to sea it s not a normal situation where whatever maritime rules that are in place need to be respected,1
why did the tsunami go so far inland and why didn t water recede after first wave and another follow,1

this is my first time seeing this there was no way for them to possibly anticipate the horror that was approaching what city or prefecture was this i send my wishes for healing and hope,0
gentle storms earthquake are a blessing from allah the almighty creator for mankind instead of wrath as a warning to approach him according to his chosen religion islam and where he completely destroyed ad thamud lut pharaoh nimrud saddad as a final punishment,1
i will always wonder if the two people by the boats who waited on the edge of the seawall one in a green coat and the other in a red coat made it out alive,0

i have no worries no one will publish your video lol,0
shut up the dog calm him down,0
you need courage to photograph devastation,0
is there an instruction for all boats to go towards the ocean incase of a tsunami,1
not instruction but if the wave is coming and you know you can t get away fast enough by docking running to your car and then out running the wave the boat is your best bet the destruction caused by the wave is basically all from it hitting land so your best chance is turning your boat pray and hit the gas straight to the wave,1

who s the dumb s standing on that wall no wonder so many people die you just stand there looking like an idiot knowing what s coming you people trying to japan must be stupid,0
that wall was supposed to have been more than enough to protect them from the biggest tsunamis they ve had historically this one was just more than they previously thought possible,1

o mankind fear your lord indeed the convulsion of the final hour is a terrible thing on the day you see it every nursing mother will be distracted from that child she was nursing and every pregnant woman will abort her pregnancy and you will see the people appearing intoxicated while they are not intoxicated but the punishment of allah is severe and of the people is he who disputes about allah without knowledge and follows every rebellious devil it has been decreed for every devil that whoever turns to him he will misguide him and will lead him to the punishment of the blaze quran 22 1 2 3 4,0
the question is why earthquakes exist the natural answer is because of the ring of fire then why the ring of fire existed why the best creator made the earth imperfect i didn t see other explanation beside the remembrance of the final hour,1

coming soon many ai fakes of the tsunamis know how to tell the difference,1
in last week people said we will have big tsunami will come to west coast in reality there is no harmful just small tsunami and weakened people are so embarrassed for believing that,1
i live in tracy and heard the tsunami sirens going off at 4 15 am this morning it s tragic,1
nothing happened,0
well atleast they got alerted,0
so there s no epstein list right trump s off the hook along with all the other unnamed pedos,0
nice story now release the files,0
very thankful when i got up this morning that i wasn t looking at reports of damage to the west coast hawaii and alaska,0
my toes got wet at low tide this morning,0
somebody ask pam bondi where she put those epstein binders,0
welcome,0
how about oprah let s talk about her lack of assistance during this potentially dangerous event,1
keep up the publicity abc the files must be released,0
fox covered this like there was a massive tsunami happening it really shows how they re just sensationalist news fake chasing clicks reactions and attention,1
crazy thing about japanese captains is the second they hear tsunami sirens they drop everything run to their boats and go full speed towards the wave even a giant tsunami is little more than a speed bump if you encounter it in deep waters it s when you get close to shore shallow water that the waves become massive in hight and crest if your boat is at dock it ll be obliterated next to norwegians the japanese are some of the best mariners on the planet,1
warning icbm incohnevermind,1
the only damage was that in the north there was three huge whales that couldn t get away,0
so california didn t get wiped out dam that sucks,0
it s a massive nothing burger,0
the good lord is telling putin to knock it off learn how to get along we need peace in this world,0
we will put some of these up on the thumbnail the horns in order to listen to things,0
im hoping for a 100ft wave these 3 5 feet is boring,1
who can be blamed for this dems trump putin come on fox can t have a story without blaming someone so who is it,0
about to hit da beach now,0
i didn t expect to love this as much as i do,0
i don t know why they sent out a warning it was an advisory but it wasn t an official warning they should have been clear about that,1
bro plz don t hit los angeles,0
russia got tsunami bombs they said it this should be a act of,1
i m sure california will be fine they have a governor prepared for situations like this i m mean californians protect yourselves don t wait for newscum to assist,0
distraction at its finest,0
media doing what they do best fear mongering for views worst part is the idiot said he didnt know how fast a tsunami traveled the threat was over a long time ago,1
i don t understand this this is like the biggest earthquake you can have and we don t get and nothing happened i m pretty sure i ve seen documentaries saying we would be so fkd 9 is like nightmare max,1
to much hype i saw online comments where people were scared ridiculous it s purposeful fear mongering,0
has anyone noticed that they never give a date to these emergencies so you can play this clip whenever you wish yesterday tomorrow next year,0
yay,0
a tsunami is what they call a tidal wave coming from japan it s a tidal wave that s what japan calls it it was no bigger than sitting on a board waiting for the 9th wave,1
isn t there a large ledge of lava on hawaii that could cause a tsunami if it breaks off,1
as predicted by the bible earthquakes in different places friends i have a new video for you on the four horsemen of the apocalypse go to papa joe fortner or shockwaves of the end times thank you and god bless you,1
when the mystic falls flood happened people were livid that there was no warning but when we are warned people get upset that nothing happened and people say slow news day this situation just proved that people are never happy no matter what i have human fatigue,1
tsunami was caused by nuclear bomb,1
sure it was an earthquake or russia testing a new bomb,1
exaggeration again,0
waiting for fox to tell me how it s obama fault,0
5 foot waves thats not that big hell find a surfer they will tell you the same thing,1
yea yea yea what are distracting us from,0
los gringos siempre exagerando,0
the earth is healing itself,0
so no big waves awesome,1
this is just the being keep starting car boat truck farmers tractors semis co2 ch4 human race well and has destroyed the earth and atmosphere we are not the smartest but the dumbest thing s to ever walk the earth,1
oh look whos warning actualy system works you can learn somethingtexas,1
imagine a 1700ft wave coming at you at 500mph,1
trump oh thank god something not epstein related,0
i can t wait to hear from the leftists on how this was trump s fault and how this tsunami alert is a kin to white supremacy,1
californi,0
i ve have the power the secret to man s red fire bic,0
we don t know for sure if this earthquake was a man made by putin setting off underground explosions or natural putin could set this off knowing that intense ones could set off tsunami waves would challenge geologists in mean time west coast folks gavin type could declare a state if emergency for federal funding,1
your never gonna make that money back guys trespassing on my land chinese dynasty west coast america,0
what about the epstein files,0
may god protect those who serve and love him dearly and genuinely i can t help but think with all of this controlled weather are they trying to wipe out locals and natives in hawaii mmmm interestinggggggg,0
trump flew on epsteins plane many times was there always a child waiting on board,0
who else is here before this blows up,0
after i die 12 25 30 there is a storm on record after i die jesus bethlehem,0
end of days,0
5 6 feet waves that s nothing bruh,1

nothing happens in california but wild fires and homeless,1

the ring of fire beautiful but it likes to rumble from time to time living in it and hearing news of places registering damages and even loss of lives due to a 4 7 is at the same time ironic to us but also we understand their pain and loss but anything above 8 is still an event in the ring,0
,0
fox using science when its convenient this time to deflect from their king s pdf phelia,0
stay safe everyone thank you bill for the news,0
fake news,0
oh god i hope the people on wake island and midway are okay,0
so another be scared we are the news thats why i hate the news,0
when it hits the continent thats when it does the most damage theres no place esle to go,0
we have satellites that measure sea height and why is it that gov green is mia again,0
fake news california has had tsunami alerts coming out of the wazoo for years yet nothing happens just sayin,1
in the bible in the book of matthew chapter 24 jesus speaks of the future and mentions all these things please accept jesus in your heart now before it s too late,0
trumps fault,0
you saying it s the same as a storm shows your lack of understanding do your homework before you report,0
in hawaii here we do know when it s going to hit,0
boy dat called wolf please call them watches unless ya know its bad sayn warning head for da hills then nothing happens people gone stop paying attention my local news and even phone told me to get into basement or bathtub cause tornado was ripping house beside me apart the sun was out never even seen a rain cloud get it together and have 3 levelband do not use warning till damage really happening,1
fox viewers believe the earth is flat this must have been jard to explain,0
trump is gonna blame biden for this,0
tds is real get help,0
oprah and the rock are asking for your support,0
silicon valley people are brave why are they running for cover they are the innovators,0
where the epstein files,0
praise god almighty for his wonderful works god is definitely visiting these wicked heathens,0
this vicious joy you get from chaos demonstrates the vaunted goodness of people like you who conceal their true nature and exploit faith religion to justify it dare i say that s tantamount to blasphemy anyone that finds joy in disasters like this is touched in the head or simply evil which one are you,1
the entire ocean column lifted and traveling 50mph is why those signs with the arrow to run uphill have always cracked me up smh i m so happy it ended up not being destructive,1
that siren warning people wont be there next week trump killed the provision for tsunami warning for the united states considering it too wasteful and expensive claiming wealthy people will know when to run anyone else isnt our problem,1
so where is tsunami,1
i didn t even get a phone alert,0
like i said trump will see i did not lie keep pushing low income to corner god got more to come,0
cali needs some water anyway,0
but sec cosplay said there s nothing to worry about,0
another opportunity to thank god for his gracious mercy and kindness we cannot take anything for granted in these times,0
so you re saying he wasn t kind when big stuff happens what a jerk,0
where was his mercy and kindness in 2004 when a tsunami killed more than 200 000 people,1
seriously where was god during the texas flooding that killed so many children,1
copernicuscraters you cant reason with them,0
copernicuscraters genesis 6 3 talks about how god s spirit will not always strive with man,0
can we not call it a tsunami no more asian hate can we call it a tidal wave,1
nice plants,0
the tsunami was programmed by the heritage foundation using christian space lasers to decimate what they call the far alt left radical unhinged crazy communist socialist state of california you know the state that pays for basic services for like three entire red states,1
so california pays for services for other states how does that work like how the nba pays for the wnba your favorite sport,0
robinly my favorite sport are you attacking like an immature 5 yr old,0
robinly you re trying to tell me you don t know that california is a massive tax donor state the likes of which several red states feed off of every single day is that what you re trying to tell me,0
robinly my favorite sport what is that some ridiculously immature attack on the wnba how old are you,0
robinly you re honestly trying to tell me that you don t know how that works do you know how many services the government provides every state every single day the problem is the absolutely broke red states take way more of my tax money than i get back because i m also in a donor state because it s blue educated and has a shred of common sense when it comes to running an economy so don t sit there and take immature jabs at me about sports teams when that road project down the street in rural alabama or louisiana or mississippi they got from me in a blue state paying in more than almost every red state remember that and if you re in a red state you should be thanking us blue state residents for what we do for you every single day time to woke all the way up you re welcome the fact is that blue states have taken care of the south the bread basket and dixieland for decades because republicans have never in a million years known anything about running an economy ever,0
teejay6063 please don t call it a tsunami can we call it something racially neutral like a tidal wave c mon man,1
robinly great idea if the word tsunami offends people you change the name it s just basic consideration respect empathy decency foresight just simple foundational basic human qualities everyone should ve been taught by their parents,1
teejay6063 do you actually think you re a good person,0
jesus is lord people pay attention,0
the biggest tsunami in usa is epstein files people hope more the people involved deny more news will came out,1
newsome will blame this on trump,0
the alaska earthquake in 1964 was 9 7 magnitude and took all of the water out of the bay and when the water came back into the bay at cordova and valdez it sent the boats way up the hill above the town and tore up most of the buildings in anchorage part of 3rd ave fell about 10 feet the earthquake proof building had the huge i beams made into pretzels the coastal areas raise 10 feet in some places and fell up to 10 feet in places the riptide in the cook inlet went from 10 to 12 foot to an average of 3 feet parts of anchorage also had thegroundopening up for a few minutes and then close back up several lives were loose because of that one area the ground came up in spirals one came up spiraling under a man driving his car and he ended up on top of it,1
ok i ll bite but it s just another nothing burger tv news for clicks story,0
release the epstein files,0
lol nothing happened big waves and cloudy so much fake news,1
so russia has figured out how to trigger an earthquake and tsunami that would strike the u s,1
god warns that even his patience has its limits,0
lol,0
went to sleep not knowing why f ing go to sleep until you know,0
there s an interview of a man that was out fishing in alaska when the big tsunami happened his and his son in a boat survived when the power of it changed the waterline of that lake forever it was an interesting interview and documentary,1
just like russia to start more problems like this,0
president trump managed the biggest tsunami with no casualties this shows his leadership and how he is far better than any democrats and liberals greatest leader of all time,1
still may be many aftershock for days,0
please i hope russians are ok i m american and live on the coast of nor cal but i don t pray for people to hurt regardless of where they live,0
i live on the beach in san diego we good,0
the fact that they need to explain what a tsunami is makes me realize how many dumb uninformed individuals there are in this country i believe they call themselves liberals,1
surfers are like meh,0
thank god,0
its fake news dont trust the news even if its a weather warning its fake news,1
what about the ships in the pacific,0
it s the safest place to be you ll have just a small wave there because of the depth the wave gets larger closer to land,1
russia did this to get back at ukraine makes you wonder,0
there was no tsunami it was ridiculous how inaccurate everybody was,1
am just waiting to see they laughed at texas,0
where those epstein files though,0
end times you guys,0
we all rip,0
well crap another sky is falling false alarm here i had glorious hopes that the left coast would be swept free of lefturds sidewalk would be clean again homeless druggies would be gone demonrats sucked out to sea for shark snacks damnit,1
trump sucks,0
people won t even surf small waves like like hit hawaii west coast you re too small this is all to do about nothing,1
russia needs to pay for this,0
weird it was like a joke,0
2 miles from a nuclear submarine base coincidence,1
little late people this is over,0
sounds like russia is creating or trying to create chaos for american coastal lands,0
i just watched a video of a guy predicting an earthquake along that plate apparently there have been series of earthquakes starting down below new zealand moving upwards towards russian and alaska,1
no matter what money is to be made by somebody que the i survived the 2025 tsunami t shirts,1
god just sent a warning,1
how many miles away not to mention tides and currents across such a distance,0
whew visiting oahu during christmas this year thank god they didn t suffer any damage,0
if they didn t know how bad it was going to be i believe i would have left to higher ground,0
is that the truth because fox has a problem with truth,0
momma can t swim,0
prez pedal file,0
warning advisory but no tsunami by now decoy hmm,1
better safe than sorry i m on the big island and would rather err on the side of caution,0
scream and shout run about,0
nothing burger here in hawaii media hype is the only tsunami,0
fake news to distract from eptein files,0
repent get saved now accept jesus christ as your lord and savior these are the birth pains read matthew 24 chapter rapture can happen at any moment don t be left behind,0
shhhhhhhudup lol,0
there was a bigger wave in my coffee this morning so much for educated scientists,1
a lot of disappointed surfers,0
if it didn t do anything to japan how s anyone else worried,0
the exaggerated animation of newscasters these days is really tiresome it minimizes any trust we have in their accuracy hype is overrated,0
nuc testing,0
i was expecting 15 or 20 foot waves not some tiny 5 foot waves,1
trying to scare the out of people,0
thank god of answering our prayers,0
breaking news warning,1
more are for sure coming,0
what a warning to russia to stop the war we are all in the same boat per se the earth stop rocking the boat russia is still having earthquakes lots of them,1
trump r children,0
can i surf today,0
that s like a king tide here in florida 4 8 ft,0
california is going to go out into the ocean eventually,0
i saw bodi out there catching the ultimate wave long live the swayze,1
so california isn t going to fall in the pacific,0
all clear release the epstein files,0
we d have to storm the capital for them to release the files,0
fox fake news i don t believe in your news,0
siren head,0
nothing burger this time,0
gotta be all because if climate change cnn and the rest will be telling us these earthquakes are gonna be more often and worse due to climate change and the useful idiots will buy it,1
bit late with this warning earthquake was yesterday,1
tomorrow s cnn headline trump and putin collude to create earthquake off russian coast greta thunberg on location,1
trump will blame obama or biden,0
what does this have to do with epstein,0
sad the locals could not use oprahs road to get to high ground instead had to travel coastal roads sad zuckerberg just purchased many more acres of land,0
well the way i see it it s better to be warned without it happening than to have it happen without being warned,0
the opposite can happen too in the midwest it s not uncommon to see people ignore tornado alarms due to the frequency of hearing them it s like the boy who cried wolf,0
early warning systems are so important lets actually fund them,1
if we were going to have a tsunami it would ve hit by now stand down,1
good test of our system safty first america has to be prepared at all times to deal with anything and every threat to even include from mother earth herself,0
even russia s weather is invading,0
governor josh green is incompetent the government agencies that have satellites which measure sea height are nasa the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration noaa and the united states geological survey usgs there was almost no impact to hawaii and in fact this still has not been published why no news about the damages because there wasn t any although this has yet to be confirmed in any respect the entire chain of islands was thrown into an evacuation panic gridlocks all over car accidents i even saw a police vehicle that had been in a crash and for what zero information no heights of the waves no impact times there are 8 major islands spread across 1500 miles and no one on any of the islands had any information about estimated impact times on any of the islands there was and still is zero information people got into car accidents and were injured because of this media driven debacle someone needs to lose their job for not consulting with the government agencies who have sea height measuring satellites and lets not forget the false hawaii nuclear icbm january 13 2018 attack ige was on watch for that and did nothing to prevent future mistakes,1
and the democrats will somehow blame trump for the tsunami,1
better safe than sorry use those tsunami sirens,1
fake,0
cnn white man threatening hawaii stay tuned,0
off the coast of russia sounds like an attack from russia from detonating a large bomb h bomb under sea to cause a tsunami on the us coast,1
praying for all my fellow americans on the west coast,0
and everywhere,0
jesus returns soon,0
even maga wouldn t send their children to mar a lago,0
so was that the ebs,0
further evidence of climate change and we must go back to covid locked down problem solved,0
yes,0
no video of the wave arriving,1
that s because there was no wave,1
let s see how fox news will make this the blue states fault any guesses,0
people need to start paying attention mr trump is pissed off we control weather if you keep pushing the epstein files on trump he will do anything to cause a distraction just wait,0
roughrider s baby,0
california can not catch a break,0

where can people on an island go to escape,0

dont lose focus people release the files don t protect the philes,0
jeffery trumpstien,0
just read some comments and i don t need to scroll in internet anymore about this topic,0
the bells work today not when they shot laser down and scorched everything,0
now the epstein files,0
it will be putin playing with his new toys,0
a tsunami isn t just one wave it can go on for many hours with many waves for those who don t understand and they can go far inland,1
you re asking fox news fans if they understand things,0
octopods1822 troll,0
so this was like the y2k scare thank goodness,0
that s beyond rude,0
putin finally declared war on america,0

litua bay not sure i spelled that right,0

japan is like oh yeah russia you re provoking tsunamis hold my beer this is going to be cold winter,1
well this time we done nothing,0
this gave me chills in the best way,0
fear mongereing,0
if god saved trump from being shot is this god now punishing us due to his rudimentary policies,0
fear mongering at its absolute best this is a sick world we live in,0
state farm just withdrew tsunami insurance from the state,1
russia russia russia,0
fire water air god only has one form of bending left to defeat california,0
thank you,0
here comes trump blaming this on biden obama and dei,0

darrellmessbarger3827 you re hysterical darrell calm down,0
why put fear in people come on now yall are not jesus,0
so what democrats are we blaming,0
they all are guilty of something that is the nature of demonrats,0
dunce,0
,0
how long until the tsunami gets blamed on trump,1
i can t believe trump s tsunami response,1
he should take a swim,0
you mean biden or obama trump and elon cut every vital program for tax cuts for the wealthy,0
trump will blame it on biden and obama,0
omglamaolol well they are at fault,0
release the epstein list,0
i wonder if this tsunami will bring the epstein files,1
have you ever considered getting a life,0
everyone can make jokes now but what if the west coast were flooded better safe than sorry and thank the lord above it didn t happen,1
off a 8 8 distraction,0
old news,0
bet they feared guam was going to capsize too have they begun building retaining walls around hawaii yet oceans are rising guam s about to capsize and all the rest of it,0
go ahead laugh when a real big one hits and thousands of lives are lost who are you going to blame ooh we weren t warned remember a hurricane called camille look it up that is what happens when signs are ignored katrina was ignored in louisiana look what happened,0
its not right that epstein stole young girls from trump the gop has strict rules governing etiquette for their raving pedoes,0
they hyping it up now what happens when something really happens with no fema,0
watch the left be like we didn t get any warnings like texas,1
why is there no alerts in texas to protect children camping,0
exactly,0
because the local politicians didn t want to pay for it look it up,0
because it s a flood that happened in minutes not a predictable wave that happens in 6 hours you dipshit,1
because they already got flooded out,1
texas is a welfare state,0
red states are poor california would have to send them money to pay for it texas can t even keep their power grid up,0
there were warnings the day before,1
they were intercepted by people with bad i intentions,0
they knew about this for days and nobody called or told them you don t need an alarm when you have so much time for a heads up people just refused to signal the alarm which would ve happened if they just refuse to call and let the people know or send someone there to let the people know they should evacuate or just have any of the people there are watch the weather one time at some point this would ve just been avoided if anybody would ve done anything but nobody did so clearly nobody knew to do it,1
fizzygillespie troll,0
you dont need an alarm when you have all these people sending prayers to god and jesus they will take care of it no doubt just pray and boom safe,0
thoughts and prayers apparently do miracles,0
earthquake weapon,1
hopefully trumps budget cuts wont cause too many fatalities,0
for california it is a surf alert they will be drawn to it,0
relax nothing gonna happen,0
the prophecy of the abyss is opening brace yourselves,0
nothing burger next,0
you can t take chances if it was ignored people would be livid many lives could have been lost better safe than sorry,0
and next time people won t pay attention at all because people are tired of the boy who cried wolf,0
jack v7o2y erring on the side of caution once isnt crying wolf people in these regions hawaii know what tsunamis are like from experience,1
jack v7o2y tell that to the people in texas champ,0
this is a planned attack from russia,0
agreeed better to be ready,0
if u live on an island you should always be prepared you are literally on an island it s not if but when,0
natural selection it is,0
opossumsrawesome6860 the over dramatizations of the events is indeed why the boy who cried wolf issue raises it s ugly head it seems every event that occurs today is characterized as the worst of all times this is why people become desensitized and that is the real problem,0
oprah is so generous,0
nothing happened to those who didn t take the vaccine,0
fizzygillespie hi child you made my point the people in texas didn t seem to worry about the rain champ,0
i used chatgpt soon as i heard the news it knew this tsunami warning was bs and it turned out to be a complete nothing burger as predicted,0
china doesn t want to trade deal with trump art of the deal,0
d b and his mommy sitting in a tree,0
ridiculous that all these us agencies caused all this panic with all these wild predictions that turned out to be a lot of nothing,0
cnn says that it was a white tsunami,1
release the files,0
this story reminds me of the time trump s hit himself on stage,0
ess tee eff yew,0
i think they re going to name this the snuffleupagus tsunami since we re hearing a lot about it but not seeing any evidence in the us,1
glad everyone is ok now we can get back to what s really important the epstein files,0
did we survived,0
no we dead,1
why are you still chirping about something that is over,0
hey news team this is done with its in the past now back to the focus on the epstein files,0
tds,0
kjb gn8mr you must be a pedi,0
does anybody else feel like this was an artificial intelligence fear algorithm or do you think that they really did care about evacuations and you know what i m saying i don t know i don t trust anybody no more i know it s so sad i always think they re up to something,0
thanks,0
is this a threat to the people of the world,0
massive fire no alerts 2 tsunami massive alerts,1
smh,0
pretending,0
wrong there was no warning and they pushed them back into the fire stupid,1
different administration,0
the first reply here is a tds toddler that lies for a nickel for beelzebub saying you cant put a tsunami out wow all this time people running for safe ground could have been putting it out instead,1
fires were an elite land grab happened in california s canyons and in la too,0
yeah well why didn t they use the alert systems when there was a massive fire,0
what did you expect from people who have the same word for goodbye as hello,0
there were multiple blazes and wind speeds were up to 90mph yeah it s easier to imagine a perfect scenario where you can catch the fire before it gets out of hand but this is real life,0
alerts cost money the trump administration doesn t think alerts for citizens is money we need to spend wasteful spending on people who aren t even wealthy just a waste,0
i was in hawaii during the 2023 fires only a few miles away we didn t even know the fires were happening until half of lahaina was gone we were inside and didn t see the smoke there were no sirens and no cell phone notifications along with the power being out on half of the island for multiple days i don t know what you are talking about,0
midwayfx thats not surprising since hawaii is a democrat place they voted for biden and kamala the last 2 elections,0
archangelmusic13 facts,0
land grabs from geoengineering the weather and earthquakes and fires,1
we threatened russia same day this happens media needs to be asking if this is a russian poseidon weapon test or not as a deterrent against the us,0
release the epstein files trump is a joke of a president,0
there was a great tsunami last november,1
nov 5th to be exact,0
honolulu does not need a tsunami warning wrong side of the island how silly,1
tsunami s can warp around islands look it up,1
and when an earthquake hits off the us west coast no longer wrong side of the island,1
cynmelly637 kaneohe 4 years,0
yeah got to admit trump is the boss of distractions,0
how the hell was trump figured in this i lived in oahu have you lived there,0
,0
in a related story a surfer rode the tsunami all the way to hawaii but struck his head on a rock and doesn t remember where he started from i guess gilligan and friends are still stuck on the island,1
are you slow,0
imagine relying on the fox cesspool for your news,0
it s trumps fault,0
so people were worried for no reason,0
no they worried because they were misinformed by by the national weather service and the us geologic service the residents ought to file a class action suit for making everyone panic and evacuate i d be pizzed off if i had spent all night in a traffic jam with a car full of crying kids these experts are losers,1
see global warming is getting worse this earthquake would never have happened if the climate weren t heating up just kidding,1
notice they changed it from global warming to climate change bec there is no heating so they can blame cooling if it goes that way 50 50 chance lol dbs,0
look at the tds toddler replying pretend it knows anything about climate change notice it calls others uneducated to make its inferiority feel better it thinks co2 is bad even though co2 is required for life on earth believes depopulation enthusiast bill gates doesn t understand plain english,0
every year the magnitude intensified litle mix of nature and the sins of mankind definitely setting the up coming of our lord this are the times jesus christ warned us about that his coming is at hand most important at this moment is pray the salvation prayer if you haven t repent from all your sins and asept jesus as your savior its the only way out look for the salvation prayer in search bar,0
0 39from russia with love,0
stop the fear mongering please if you keep telling people that giant tsunami s are heading their way and they see that your stupid predictions are nothing but bs they will ignore your so called experts when something really bad happens and millions could die because of you a 3 foot surge is not a tsunami it is a 3 foot surge just stop it and get some help please,1
no loss in either case,0
fox is a sewer,0
stinky is so jealous,0
get off the surfboard and get off the beach,0
i can t help but wonder about the next episode of the view how they will somehow blame the earthquake on trump,1
naw we just want donald the kid diddler in jail,0
reminds me of dems created the hurricane rhetoric,0
trumpisgaay insane tds er with chronic bed wetting and thumb sucking issues grow up little boy,0
tune in truth still rockin the brain power not understanding algorithms,0
they blamed him before the earthquake struck,1
devon362 pretends geoengineering doesnt exist probably isnt smart enough to,0
why bring that moron into conversation can t we have one day without dump being brought up,0
stop it was was not that bad stop the fear factor crap,0
hey magats when you hug your kids tonight try not to get an ewrecktion its embarrassing and the police might go after you like they did trump,0
mr madison what you ve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul,0
ess tee eff yew,0
get professional help,0
magats gift wrap their daughters and consider it loyal to give them to the orange shitstain,0
catitude4 you re the one in a p do cult,0

someone track this account back to source,0
shapeshifter o4e hit a bit too close to home for you why are you protecting a p do,0
shapeshifter o4e why you scared,0
bot,0
the big ones coming this is ironing it out,0
i got my board waxed and went out to ride the big one never came,0
i figured this is what hawaiians would do to be honest lmao,0
not very smart regarding tsunamis you d have to know how to surf backwards,1
lorettanericcio bohlman567 not very smart to recognize an obvious joke,0
trump says the epstein files are boring and maga is too stupid to see them,0
wear your ignorance with pride,0
406fundays i wear your mom like a hat on my mushroom,0
you are truly smoothed brained,0
zell31339 where s the lie genius,0
aoc and crockett have announced that they will looking into russian ties between trump and the tsunami adam schiff is claiming that he had indisputable evidence that the tsunami and trump which was why the tsunami caused so little damage to american states,1
,0
they re putting out old news because the tsunami didn t do enough damage to report on good news is no news so that s why they re replaying the old stuff,1
the alaka 1958 wave was generated not generated by a massive rock but a rockslide composed of millions of tons that slide into a narrow bay jeez do these so called reporters news people check anything before they say something stupid,1
can we please just back to trump telling the world how he d like to pork ivanka if she wasn t his kid,0
stinky s trying for some nickels today,0
nothing happened what else is new,0
thank goodness nothing happened let me guess you don t live on beach front property and you dont dive,0
the democrats will never have the courage to tax the rich socialist owners of corporations or ridiculously wealthy communist profiteers,0
remember when trump said he d boink ivanka if he wasn t happily married,0
do you get another nickel stinky,0
russia testing its weapon on the us,0
just like a king tide here on maui,0
wailuku pal,0
it s a town name it s not translated maybe saying using google maps would have been an intelligent thing to say trump is your president,0
theofficialken1755 not mine ken,0
lorettanericcio bohlman567 if you are in the us yes he is if you are not in the us he s just sir or daddy to you,0
theofficialken1755 maui is a character in moana,0
leegee ex9ri maui is a polynesian demigod there are other islands named maui in the pacific lived here 10 years,0
theofficialken1755 i know i ve seen the movie,0
leegee ex9ri well then thanks for sharing,0
very grateful that there was very little to no actual tsunami from the earthquake,1
ikr i was really worried that we would see something similar to what happened in japan back in 2011,0
people are too dramatic tsunamis are weak as hell,1
mikapirate e5e have you seen tsunamis hit in the indian ocean in 2004 and the japan tsunami of 2011 i m just saying tsunamis are incredibly powerful and dangerous,1
mikapirate e5e right except for that one in 2004 that killed a quarter million people,0
me too,0
mikapirate e5e you re not too smart are you,0
mikapirate e5e tell me you know nothing about historical tsunamis,1
mikapirate e5e have you ever been in a tsunami before cause tsunamis are definitely not weak,1
mikapirate e5e 2 foot tsunamis alone is enough to bring you by a current if it s speeds are fast enough it can literally take you like a floating cereal in a bowl of milk they re no joke even a normal deep pool is not the easiest experience for normal people the pressure feels a bit tight on their lungs and swimming is not the best especially when the currents are unpredictable,1
mikapirate e5e you re not the smartest person out there did you not see the 2004 tsunami in japan are slow or something,1
mikapirate e5e tell that to the 280 000 people that died in the 2004 boxing day tsunami u numb digger,1
mikapirate e5e extremely dumb take,0
audreeambani98 tsunamis are racist,1
i was lie then in middle school our teachers told us if a earthquake happens it makes tsunamis i wonder what else they lie to me,1
i bet beach combing tomorrow is going to be insane,0
mikapirate e5e right just like the ones that killed 240 000 people in s e asia,0
japanese people get hit by a 5 foot wave and wanna cry that a big tsunami hit them unless it s a rogue 40ft wave like in the movies tsunamis are like any other wave in the ocean,1
mikapirate e5e maybe you should look at the total deaths of 2011 and 2004 tsunami s before you go yapping this garbage your comments are an embarrassment and a shame to those who drowned horribly in those so called 5 foot waves those waves were 10 s of feet and unlike a rogue wave they dont just stop after the first one in fact the 2nd and 3rd waves are generally bigger and more powerful than the first also look at the total damage costs of the 2011 tsunami in japan you are either very blind ignorant or both im betting on both probably a flat earther too,1
this is old news c mon,0
godzilla size waves haha,1
keep voting democrat california clowns,0
we sure will what s your point,0
so hawaii has a tsunami warning alarm just not a fire alarm,1
also a missile incoming warning,1
wheres the relief money,0
missile was a false alarm some dingus pressed it it made the news,0
mr bubbles32 oops,0
dude in 2023 summer in july right before the fire i was there in maui and the fire alarms in my hotel went off at 2 30 am as a test i guess it was a sign,0
don t ask questions,0
but god can,0
california is the state that needs a fire alarm,0
st louis recently,0
fire alarms are woke and anti trump,0
briancooper2112 the fire alarms stole it,0
mr bubbles32 wasnt me,0
makes you wonder,0
duh but you can evacuate lol,1
dont take this as accurate info but i believe hawaii s volcano observatory is responsible for relaying seismograph info to the state obviously in the time we live in that data is tracked globally basically 24 7 with countries that have the ability to monitor tectonic activity it s a matter of having an eam system in place that can warn citizens in enough time before catastrophic events,0
fire alarms were not included in the budget to criminally acquire premium real estate,0
ha neither did la it s called woke crap both states the rich woke benefited swooping up land from less fortunate,0
ohhhh snap,0
hawaii used the old outdated system like texas,0
briancooper2112 biden gave it to ukraine,0
icydawn9 15 24 biden and his son gave it to putin,0
the sirens didn t work on august 23,0
mariateixeira6379just like the cameras didn t work the nite jeffry epstein died disappeared,0
russia is sending tsunami waves to the us what is this administration doing,1
i thought you tds toddlers didnt believe in geoengineering ahh only if you can blame twump mommy waahh,0
laughing at ignorance and stupidity,0
more alarmism by the narcissistic media and scientists under the guise of we are trying to keep you safe you ever hear of the fable called the boy who cried wolf,0
just another natural disaster for the trump administration to ignore,1
tds toddler earning its nickel,0
you do realize that he alone doesnt control the weather right its not his job to get those states to evacuate its those states that defy every order he gives besides maybe hawaii and alaska theres always one of you in the comments lol i say let the whole west coast fall into the sea except hawaii and alaska,1
california needs a good clean up from all the degeneracy,0
deltab j4p haha remember when he tried to act like he did control the weather and used sharpie on the map to convince people the hurricane would reach farther hahaha can t even make this up,0
lol can t hear you joe through your mask gtfoh,0
goodfella 618 thats like saying you d listen to someone giving you medical advice that wasn t a doctor sometimes you have to ignore what people say theres alot of powerful people out there that think they know everything but i choose not to listen to nonsense,0

the tsunami will come in the midterms and it will be a massive blue wave,1
epstein files not so awesome lol,0
seek help loon,0
man isn t trump so great i mean there s a list of reasons to love him,0
can t wait to see how cnn is going to pin this one on trump,0
this is fox news though,0
incoming tds toddlers blaming twump for a nickel,0
can t wait to see how fox frames this as trump intervening in some divine fashion to save hawaii from a tsunami,1
that would be magats blaming natural disasters on dems but carry on,1
how do you explain epstein files not being released is this cnn s fault lol,0
lol ikr,0
god is mad at trump for protecting epstein,0
cnn california hit with a 100 foot tidal surge and it had white caps,1
