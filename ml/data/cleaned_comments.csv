https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUC5kNCMetY,@integralmath,"lol. Where on Earth did you hear that tsunamis at sea collect more and more water as they travel? They absolutely do not gather anything as they travel throughout the open ocean. The one thing, and, indeed, the only thing that a tsunami does is alter the height of the water through which the wave propagates. There are two component concepts to understand tsunami action in the open ocean: energy density and group velocity. When the velocity is high, the energy density is low. In the open ocean, the wave's energy has a lot of space to spread out, which reduces the energy density of the wave; that increases its speed.

Crucially, none of the water molecules travel with the wave; rather, the wave travels through them and they merely serve as the medium. Consider a sound wave and a piece of wood. If someone is on one end of a board and another on the other side and one of them taps the end, the pieces of wood from his end do not travel with the sound wave. Rather, the sound wave use the molecules in the wood to propagate through.

As the wave front approaches shallower water, the energy that was previously spread out deep to the ocean floor no longer has the same space available, and the energy in the wave therefore begins to become more and more compressed. The same time, the wave front slows down and the water is elevated by the upward motion of the energy being reflected off of the sea floor. Since the amount of energy to be dissipated doesn't change until it has something to absorb it, a slower speed means that water level has to rise to compensate for there being more energy per unit volume. This is technically known as wave shoaling.

The energy available per unit volume can displace a given quantity of water, which will be higher than the surrounding water levels. This repeats and repeats as the bottom surface is shallower and shallower, until such time as things begin to be moved in such fashion that they no longer return to their original position. This tendency of water particles to not be carried with the wave is called its free orbital motion: it moves in happy little circles* when a wave propagates through its region; it goes up, a bit in one direction, falls and back in the opposite direction where it stops at its original position.

When that is unbalanced by high energy density waves in shallow water, you these molecules no longer return to their original position. They are then transformed into translational motion and gets moving forward. And taking everything it can with it.

*this is because the seafloor is not infinitely far away and because water is not perfectly incompressible. Under those conditions, the motion would satisfy a degenerate case of orbital motion. It's a technical point that's not worth saying more on other than noting that I'm perfectly well aware of the underlying physics and actual motion in the real world and why reality doesn't perfectly follow mathematical modeling.",4,,lol earth hear tsunami sea collect water travel absolutely gather anything travel throughout open ocean one thing indeed thing tsunami alter height water wave propagates two component concept understand tsunami action open ocean energy density group velocity velocity high energy density low open ocean wave energy lot space spread reduces energy density wave increase speed crucially none water molecule travel wave rather wave travel merely serve medium consider sound wave piece wood someone one end board another side one tap end piece wood end travel sound wave rather sound wave use molecule wood propagate wave front approach shallower water energy previously spread deep ocean floor longer space available energy wave therefore begin become compressed time wave front slows water elevated upward motion energy reflected sea floor since amount energy dissipated change something absorb slower speed mean water level rise compensate energy per unit volume technically known wave shoaling energy available per unit volume displace given quantity water higher surrounding water level repeat repeat bottom surface shallower shallower time thing begin moved fashion longer return original position tendency water particle carried wave called free orbital motion move happy little circle wave propagates region bit one direction fall back opposite direction stop original position unbalanced high energy density wave shallow water molecule longer return original position transformed translational motion get moving forward taking everything seafloor infinitely far away water perfectly incompressible condition motion would satisfy degenerate case orbital motion technical point worth saying noting perfectly well aware underlying physic actual motion real world reality perfectly follow mathematical modeling

Ultimately, it's an issue of Psychology & Sociology/Culture. For starters, people ignore warnings, don't prepare for disasters, and don't use safety equipment (motorcycle helmets, seatbelts, wearing safety glasses, etc.) because (a) perceiving risks & understanding concepts like 'randomness', 'odds of death' is difficult, and (b) preparing for bad events requires them to accept their own vulnerability & mortality. Many people (especially teenagers & young adults) have great difficulty accepting how dangerous & 'random' the world can be, and find it difficult to accept that they cannot take complete control of their environment. On top of that, some cultures seem to encourage risk taking more & tolerate a higher rate of injuries/mortality among its youth (..the U.S.A. is a good example...when compared to other '1st-world' nations, it has the highest rate of accidental injury/death among youth & young adults...)

Furthermore there has been a gender factor: Young males also feel peer pressure & think that they're supposed to be able to deal with dangers, protect others, and prove that they're strong. Furthermore, higher levels of testosterone in males definitely causes males to (a) experience less fear, but more anger/aggression when threatened in any situation (except in really scary situations), (b) be less risk-adverse, and (c) feel more confident in their physical & intellectual abilities. Having said that, over the last 50 years, there has been an increase in injuries & mortality among female teenagers/young adults, especially in 'western' societies, which suggests that risky behaviour is not just biochemical, but also heavily influenced by societal factors (..perhaps role models, more exposure to risk/danger in careers that used to be male dominated etc.?).

I hope this helps....",0,,raised fair question apply tsunami type natural disaster certainly applies issue personal safety ultimately issue psychology sociology culture starter people ignore warning prepare disaster use safety equipment motorcycle helmet seatbelt wearing safety glass etc perceiving risk understanding concept like randomness odds death difficult preparing bad event requires accept vulnerability mortality many people especially teenager young adult great difficulty accepting dangerous random world find difficult accept cannot take complete control environment top culture seem encourage risk taking tolerate higher rate injury mortality among youth good example compared world nation highest rate accidental injury death among youth young adult furthermore gender factor young male also feel peer pressure think supposed able deal danger protect others prove strong furthermore higher level testosterone male definitely cause male experience less fear anger aggression threatened situation except really scary situation less risk adverse feel confident physical intellectual ability said last year increase injury mortality among female teenager young adult especially western society suggests risky behaviour biochemical also heavily influenced societal factor perhaps role model exposure risk danger career used male dominated etc hope help

PRIMEIRA - sera que o pessoal nao estava rindo exatamente por estar extremamente nervoso? Muitas pessoas (e eu ja vi isso) quando estao ""com os nervos a flor da pele"" comecam a rir. Eh o tal do ""riso nervoso"".
SEGUNDA - a pessoa que estava operando a camera estava sem nenhum tripe, ou coisa parecida,  para apoia-la, segurando-a, provavelmente, nas maos --- e pior, dava um zoom para capturar imagens a quilometros de distancia. Darei um exemplo: com uma camera nas maos, tente gravar a imagem de um aviao que voa ""la, longe"" de onde voce esta; nao ha como o aviao nao sair ""tremido"" no video.
MAS, CONCORDO PLENAMENTE COM VOCE: o nosso amigo cineasta cometeu o pecado de nao parar em nenhuma imagem! Assim, eh preciso gostar muito de tsunamis para ver o video inteiro; alem, claro, do tremendo esforco do cerebro para acompanhar 1 hora de imagens tremidas.
Mas, mesmo assim, valeu pelo registro, nao eh mesmo?
Se eu estivesse no lugar dele, esqueceria camera, tripe, heroismo, e sairia correndo...
Ou nadando...
Ou voando como um super-homem enlouquecido, tentando ""salvar a pele a qualquer custo""!!!...

The entire Japanese Tsunami Defence Network was designed and built to protect against a tsunami reaching 10 metres/30 feet.

At its peak run up, the Tsunami reached 40 metres/133 feet, and it inundated inland to a distof 9.6 kilometres/6 miles.

Tsunami Safety Centres, Safety Structures, and Safety Zones were located and constructed based on the 10 metre/30 feet tsunami prediction.

Consequently, survivors crammed into those supposed safety places died in their thousands when they were inundated, wiping out entire generations of families that had together sought shelter.

Japan had a brutal realisation that their world famous sea defence network, the longest, most sophisticated system ever created, was utterly overwhelmed by the actual reality of nature.

Quite what their original prediction of 10 metres/30 feet was based on has never been explained. 

Nor has the reason for constructing a nuclear power station directly on the coast, at the exact area known for earthquakes and tsunamis!

There was almost no impact to Hawaii, and in fact this still has not been published. WHY?  No news about the damages because there wasn’t any ( although this has yet to be confirmed in any respect )  the entire chain of  islands was thrown into an evacuation panic, gridlocks all over-  car accidents, i even saw a police vehicle that had been in a crash.  And for what?  Zero information! No heights of the waves.  No impact times-   There are 8 major islands spread across 1500 miles-  and no one on any of the islands had any information about estimated impact times on ANY of the islands! There was and still is zero information! People got into car accidents and were injured because of this media driven debacle. Someone needs to lose their job for not consulting with the government agencies who have sea height measuring satellites.  And lets not forget the false hawaii nuclear ICBM january 13, 2018 attack.
