"there's been something speaking/growling/snarling/laughing with a d3monic sounding voice for almost the whole video. i couldn't really understand what it was saying for most of it, but at 25:07 it sounds like it says, ""do you RRREALLY .."" i have to loop it a few more times to try to figure out the rest of what it's saying..

edit: i believe it's saying ""do you RRREALLY ..think you're not gonna di3?"" 
(i have to alter the way i write certain words or my comment will be removed)
it's still talking and snarling after that. really difficult to understand exactly what it's saying, but i'm sure it isn't nice. i'll add more time stamps if it speaks loudly and clearly enough for everyone else to hear.

27:09 you hear a small child sing-song something in her language. then you can hear ""shut....up...the BITCH"" the last 2 words are loudest at 27:14
it's been adding its two cents in and snarling the whole time since the last time stamp, but at 32:14 you can hear it's really getting fed up with them in its space, so it shouts ""GO!"" lol 

the whole thing is blowing my mind, from the fact this thing really exists and is talking, to the fact it is speaking in english. why is it speaking in English??

44:32 a completely different entity is speaking. i don't understand what it's saying. typical ghost whisper

I'm in Medford and don't think it could reach the Rogue River near here this far inland, but the mountains might just end up helping the tsunami end up more inland due to the rivers.

id like to hear more from survivors and more of the experiences i've watched some but its incredible to think most those building got reduced into splinters and back to the foundations i really don't think the people still don't see how much danger they were in even when the port and the docks disappeared slowly they were casually watching its only until most of the structures were gone that they knew they were in trouble.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cys8581RSXE,@ryanjamespemberton9190,0,

"""O mankind, fear your Lord. Indeed, the convulsion of the [final] Hour is a terrible thing.
On the Day you see it every nursing mother will be distracted from that [child] she was nursing, and every pregnant woman will abort her pregnancy, and you will see the people [appearing] intoxicated while they are not intoxicated; but the punishment of Allah is severe.
And of the people is he who disputes about Allah without knowledge and follows every rebellious devil.
